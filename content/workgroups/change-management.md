The goal of this effort is to define a common set of resources, formats and [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restful) services for the use in Change Management tools and use by [ALM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management), [PLM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_Lifecycle_Management), Integrated Service Management (ISM) and DevOps tools.

[Change Management (CM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_management_(engineering)) resources define the change requests and tasks of the software and hardware delivery lifecycle. These resources relate and interact with many other resources such as projects, products, or categories.
