Architecture Management (AM) is all about the evolution of the ideas and requirements driving the business needs and seeing them fulfilled in the applications and systems created by coordinated development teams. These activities include traditional planning, analysis, design and construction, and governance. However the emphasis is shifted to the driving business factors, and to the management of cross project and enterprise-level concerns. It also is concerned with how to do this in a constantly evolving environment. Architecture management strives to maintain the architectural integrity of solutions amid the constant churn of requirements, technology and business factors.

The tools of architecture management include those used in requirements management and change management and they introduce modeling as a first class artifact in the ALM story.
