Requirements Management (RM) resources define the requirements or capabilities of a system or the outcome of some programme of work. We use the term system entirely generally and without prejudice to software, hardware, IT, regulatory, business etc.

Requirements are the basis for defining what the system stakeholders (users, customers, suppliers and so on) need from a system and also what the system must do in order to meet those needs, and how the surrounding processes must be orchestrated so that quality, scope and timescale objectives are satisfied. RM is inherently multi-disciplinary and across the life-cycle; it brings together all assets across the life-cycle, ascribing them meaning, captures their dependencies and interrelationships and ultimately, and describes how they together produce the desired system.
