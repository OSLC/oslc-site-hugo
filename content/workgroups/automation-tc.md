The goal of the OSLC Lifecycle Integration for Automation TC is to enable the interoperation of automation processes among IT systems such as servers, workstations, and smart hand-held devices. OSLC Automation standards seek to improve efficiency and reduce the need for human interactions in the software development, test, deployment, and operations lifecycle phases.
