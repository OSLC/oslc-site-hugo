PROSTEP would like to announce to the OSLC community, that there is an OpenPDM OSLC Adapter which enables PLM systems to connect to the OSLC world. It offers OSLC standard services, especially for those PLM systems which don’t offer native ones. The adapter is an add-on for the OpenPDM integration framework which provides connectors to a wide range of systems, e.g.:

Ansys EKM
Aras Innovator
Autodesk Vault
Dassault SmarTeam
Dassault ENOVIA V6
Dassault ENOVIA VPM V4
MSC SimManager
Oracle Agile ePLM
PTC Windchill
SAP PLM
Siemens Teamcenter Engineering
Siemens Teamcenter Enterprise
Siemens Teamcenter UA
The OpenPDM OSLC services can be integrated in any OSLC consuming applications. The supported features are:

OSLC Service Providers  (OSLC Core 2.0)
Jazz specific Root Service
Change Request Resources:
as RDF/XML
as JSON  (OSLC CM 2.0)
Query Capabilities (OSLC Core 2.0)
Selection UI (OSLC Core 2.0)
OAuth
Link documents managed in Backend as related resource to OSLC CM entity
Provide download for documents
A very successful project was performed by PROSTEP at Bombardier Transportation. The IBM tool Rational Team Concert was integrated with Teamcenter Enterprise from Siemens PLM. Rational Team Concert is used for managing the creation and delivery of documents which are needed for the authorisation of their products by European Union (EU) or local country bodies. The requirements are managed in Rational Doors Next Generation. The documents are stored in their central PDM system Teamcenter and linked to the RTC tasks. Teamcenter Enterprise doesn’t provide a native OSLC service and is now enabled by the OpenPDM OSLC Adapter to be accessed by RTC via OSLC. The project was defined, performed and finished successfully in close cooperation with IBM.
