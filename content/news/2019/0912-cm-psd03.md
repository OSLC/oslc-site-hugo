We finally have some great news to share! After starting the OSLC Open Project in May 2019 and having
a long summer with various people being off for vacations, we have prepared the first
specification for publication, updated the templates and fixed major outstanding issues. The OSLC
OP Project Governing Board [has approved](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/oslc-op-pgb/message/27)
the publication of the Change Management 2.1 PSD (Project Specification Draft) 03.

This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for
the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and
related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources. To support these
scenarios, this specification defines a set of HTTP-based RESTful interfaces in terms of HTTP
methods: GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, HTTP response codes, content type handling and resource formats.
The [table of all specs](https://open-services.net/specifications/) has been updated to point to the
newly published draft, which is available in the OASIS repository for OSLC specs: [OSLC CM 2.1
PSD 03](https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/cm/v3.0/psd03/change-mgt-spec.html).

The project contributors have already submitted the next draft (for the Requirements Management 2.1 spec) for the PGB vote and PSDs for the Core and Quality management are on the way! We are waiting for [your contribution](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
