The September 2015 elections for the OASIS OSLC Steering Committee have concluded -- congratulations to the new and re-elected members!  

Also noteworthy is that as of this election, the number of Steering Committee members increased from 7 to 9.  The expanded breadth and experience that is represented in the new Steering Committee will further enhance its ability to guide and serve the OSLC Member Section and community.

As we transition to the new Steering Committee, a big thank-you to departing members John Wiegand and Dave West for their service and numerous contributions to OSLC and the Steering Committee. 

Now is a great time to get involved in Open Services and OASIS OSLC. Please consider joining a User Group, contribute to an OASIS technical committee, post questions on the Forum and follow us on Social media including @OSLCNews and OSLC LinkedIn Group.

Thank you, 

Nelson Jean
