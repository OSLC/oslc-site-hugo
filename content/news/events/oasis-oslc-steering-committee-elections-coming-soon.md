Whether you live in the I/T or Systems world, software integration in heterogeneous environments can represent both a challenge (where do I even start?) and opportunity (how can I advance my environment to provide more value, deliver faster and with reduced risk?).

Communities like openservices and OASIS OSLC collaboratively discuss lifecycle integration challenges and solutions that leverage open standards. Whether you're here to contribute your knowledge and experience or to learn from others, we're all in it together. 

If you're interested in working with other leaders in this space and helping influence the direction and expansion of OSLC, consider becoming a member of OASIS OSLC Steering Committee.  Nominations and elections for positions on the Steering Committee will occur this September 2015. If you have questions in the meantime please review the Steering Committee “Best Practices” document or  post questions to the OSLC General Discussion Forum. 

More details to come soon!
