Coming in a couple weeks is [IBM's new InterConnect](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/) conference which brings together past IBM events (Innovate, Pulse, Impact) into one.  These conferences often contain a number of sessions and events with OSLC connect.  As you are building your agenda for the conference, I wanted to highlight my sample agenda which has some key sessions that either talking directly about OSLC activities or other topics that are key to OSLC activities.

[Attached you'll find a PDF of my full sample agenda](http://open-services.net/images/uploads/blog/OSLCatInterConnect-SampleSchedule.pdf), though here are some key events/sessions to be aware of:
