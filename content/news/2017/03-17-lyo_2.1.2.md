Eclipse Lyo 2.1.2 has been released today! This was the first release carried out by Jad El-khoury, Jim Amsden, and yours truly. We went through a release review process even though it is not strictly needed for the service releases just in order to get acquainted with the process.

This release has mainly [addressed issues](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.lyo/releases/2.1.2/bugs) in the client (28 issues) and core (9 issues). I would like to thank all contributors who submitted the patches!

As of now, artefacts under `groupId=org.eclipse.lyo.clients` and `groupId=org.eclipse.lyo.oslc4j.core` are available under `artifactId=2.1.2`. Please make sure your POM file specifies the [correct repositories](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/LyoOSLC4J#Using_in_Maven).

The Javadoc sites are also published:

- http://download.eclipse.org/lyo/docs/core/2.1.2/overview-summary.html
- http://download.eclipse.org/lyo/docs/client/2.1.2/overview-summary.html

We will be starting to work on [2.2.0 roadmap](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=510999
) soon. We are looking forward to your feedback on Lyo 2.1.2 and bug reports as well patches for 2.2.0!
