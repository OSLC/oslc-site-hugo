title = "Why aren't OSLC specifications W3C standards?"
answer = "W3C is focused on shaping the future of the Internet Architecture. OASIS on the other hand focuses on the development, convergence and adoption of open standards for the global information society. OSLC uses and builds on the W3C REST Internet Architecture including HTTP and LDP. However, OSLC is a use of the REST architecture in support of lifecycle management tool integration, it does not contribute to that architecture."
