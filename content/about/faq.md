# Community

Software developers and organizations working to create a foundation for how software lifecycle tools share data (for example, requirements, defects, test cases, plans, or code) with one another.

# Objectives

* Easier development of tool integrations
* Easier to plug in different tools to an engineering environment
* Easier to link data together from disparate repositories and analyze
* Minimalistic specifications
* Based on Web standards

# Specifications

* Provides open specifications for service descriptions and cross-tool communication
* Specifications in development migrating to OASIS
