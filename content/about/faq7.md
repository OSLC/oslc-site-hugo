answer = "Swagger.io is a popular framework of API developer tools for describing and managing REST APIs. SmartBear Software donated the Swagger Specification directly to the Open API Initiative (OAI) as the basis of the Open Specification managed by openapis.org. The  OAI was created to support an industry standard for describing REST APIs in order to promote application integration. OSLC is one such REST API, that can be described using Swagger.io, that defines a standard set of application integration capabilities that have been found useful in creating development and lifecycle management toolchains. OSLC defines REST APIs for discovery, standard CRUD operations based on HTTP using LDP and RDF resource representations, delegated dialogs for resource selection and creation across applications, resource preview for human readable links, and a simple query capability."
