title = "What is the difference between OSLC and a SPARQL endpoint?"
answer = "A SPARQL endpoint is provided by a REST server that supports the execution of SQPARL queries and returns the query results either constructed RDF graphs or result sets in a standard format. OSLC also supports a query capability, but is not coupled directly to SPARQL. OSLC query was intended to specify a simple, easy to implement, reasonably efficient to execute query language that could be adapted to many different data sources including SQL, and RDF data sources supporting SPARQL. That is, OSLC query capability is meant to be data source independent, and therefore enabling query across different data sources, including those that support SPARQL."
