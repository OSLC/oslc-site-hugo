title = "What is the difference between OSLC and microservices?"
answer = "OSLC defines a set of application integration capabilities based on HTTP, RDF and LDP. Microservices represent an architectural style that factors applications into loosely coupled services that implement business capabilities. This is not a new concept. The ideas of maximizing functional cohesion and minimizing coupling in order to support efficient and effective development, maintenance and reuse of application components is the foundation of modern software engineering disciplines. Microservices are often build on the WWW REST architecture, and have become a popular way of developing RESTful applications. OSLC clients and servers assembled into toolchains that implement different, but related domains could be seen as assemblies of microservices. For example, a Requirements Management server could be connected with a Change Management server in a tool chain. Each of these servers could be considered to provide microservices that enable the integration in order to determine the work required to implement requirements."
