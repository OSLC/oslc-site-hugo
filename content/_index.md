title1 = "About"
about1 = "Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform [LDP], to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully."
about2 = "OSLC consists of a Hypermedia API standard and RDF-based specifications for data interoperability. We are an open community that works together on specifications, software, and initiatives to expose more data on the private and public Web to surface up the advantages of having better integration."
more = "Learn more"

titleDataSilos = "Breaking Down Data Silos"
paragraph1DataSilos = "The Web has broken down barriers to connect documents (e.g. web pages, images) across different servers. Now, the Web is braking broken down barriers to connect data across different databases."
paragraph2DataSilos = "This initiative is called Linked Data and was developed by the inventor of the Web Tim Berners Lee. Learn more on breaking down data silos through this HBR article."
image1DataSilos = "img/data-silos.png"
paragraph3DataSilos = "Linked Data can also be used to connect private data on the private enterprise Web, as done typically with OSLC REST APIs."
paragraph4DataSilos = "Linked Data uses RDF as data format which can be described in many formats including JSON and XML. OSLC REST APIs expose data in RDF to enable the connection of data using open Web standards."

title2 = "Hypermedia API"
hypermedia1 = "Hypermedia APIs are the most powerful type of REST APIs. They embody the Web principles of flexibility, standardization, and loose coupling to a service. They scale better, are more easily changed and provide better discoverability to consumers of the API."

title4 = "OSLC Specifications"
corespec = "The OSLC Core Specification is a Hypermedia API standard currently mainly adopted in software and systems engineering domains, but with the potential to provide value to any domain with data integration challenges. The OSLC Core specifications expands on the W3C LDP capabilities, to define the essential and common technical elements of OSLC domain specifications and offers guidance on common concerns for creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources."
domainsspec = "OSLC domain-specific specifications define the equivalent of schemas in RDF for enabling data interoperability. They consist of RDF vocabularies and OSLC resource shapes. RDF vocabularies are used to describe standardized resource types and properties. OSLC resource shapes are used to define constraints such as multiplicity constraints on properties of specific resource types."

title5 = "The OSLC Stack"
stack1 = "OSLC builds on Web standards, from codified ones like HTTP and LDP, to de-facto ones like REST that power applications today."

title6 = "Ecosystem"
ecosystem1 = "OSLC moves beyond the borders of this site, with the ecosystem made up of developers working on implementations, specification working groups at OASIS and the W3C, and passionate individuals and organisations that get behind the cause of data integration and interoperability."

title7 = "Solutions"
solutions1 = "OSLC is a foundational pillar of data integration solutions, and opens up a whole new set of possibilities for applications on the Web."

title8 = "Implementations"
implementations1 = "OSLC is already being used in a number of real-world scenarios... Introduce native and adapters"

caseContent1 = "OSLC enables you to choose the best tools, independent of vendor and version, for your job and have them interact seamlessly to achieve traceability and visibility with the rest of your organization"

caseContent2 = "OSLC frees you to focus on your core competencies by enabling you to create software using reusable and open assets that will interoperate with other tools both inside and outside your influence providing time and cost savings."

caseContent3 = "OSLC enables users, developers and third parties to realize increased value and opportunity through improved and open integration of software, and it incites innovation in both software and service communities"

resourcesTitle = "Resources"
resourcesContent = "Seeing is doing, so come and learn how to do things. In the resources section of the site, you will find various resources to help including tutorials, videos, articles, and presentations."
resourcesTutorials = "Tutorials"
resourcesArticles = "Articles"
resourcesPresentations = "Presentations"
resourcesVideos = "Videos"
resourcesTutorialsText = "Do you like being walked through things? We have some useful tutorials to help."
resourcesArticlesText = "There is an abundance of articles related to OSLC out there. Here we try to gather them into one place."
resourcesPresentationsText = "Whether you are a slides fanatic, or need something to show off OSLC, we have options for you."
resourcesVideosText = "Learn by watching and listening. We'll surface up the best videos on the OSLC community."
