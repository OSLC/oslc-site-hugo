The Eclipse Lyo project focuses on providing an SDK to help the Eclipse community to adopt OSLC specifications and build OSLC-compliant tools. The [source code is available in a Git repository](http://git.eclipse.org/c/?q=lyo).

1. OSLC4J: [A Java toolkit](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/LyoOSLC4J) to help you build OSLC-ready Java applications
2. Test suites: Verify that your OSLC implementations are [compliant with the specifications](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/LyoTestSuite)
3. Reference Implementations: See how OSLC functions with [working samples](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Lyo/BuildRIO)
