+++

A toolkit for developing OSLC consumers and providers for .NET environments that contains the following tools:

* __OSLC4NET SDK__, which is very similar to the OSLC4J component of Eclipse Lyo: you can model OSLC resources as .NET objects, annotate them with OSLC attributes, and use the REST services provided by ASP.NET MVC 4 for HTTP requests and request handling.
* __OSLC Change Management consumer implementation__ in the form of a test suite
