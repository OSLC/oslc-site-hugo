contentUsers2 = "For instance, a QA professional can view requirements that are managed by a requirements management tool, and create live links between test cases and requirements, without leaving the test management tool. Mock quote: Thanks to OSLC, I can simply follow links to navigate between related requirements, design elements, work items and test cases across our multi-vendor toolset. Mock quote: “Because of historic integration problems, we used to have to use back levels of all the tools. With our OSLC-enabled toolset we use the latest releases of our preferred software and still have integration with the rest of our organization"

contentVendors2 = "For instance, you can build one interface to interoperate with multiple tools, and which eliminates rework caused by changes in tool versions."

contentDevelopers2 = "For example, you will be better able to integrate disjointed workflows and reuse information more efficiently, while at the same time reducing the integration costs and proprietary concerns attributed to the use of less open software. Mock quote: Software, and it’s integration, is a cost of creating our products. OSLC helps minimize that cost while also improving and increasing our capabilities. OSLC helps us deliver better quality products sooner."
