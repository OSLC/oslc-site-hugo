The table below provides a convenient place to see the currently available OSLC specifications, their status, and links to the documents.  Many of these specifications are still under development so you should consult the actual documents for the most up to date information.

All OSLC specifications are governed by [OASIS Technical Committees](http://www.oasis-oslc.org) including:

* [OSLC Core Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/oslc-core)
* [OSLC Domains Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/oslc-domains)
* [OSLC PROMCODE Technical Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/oslc-promcode)

The titles below are abbreviated for convenience. The full titles a available from the linked documents. For multi-part specifications, typically only the main specification is listed. The other parts are available from that specification.
 
Status refers to the OASIS Standards Track Work Products in the [OASIS Naming Directives](http://docs.oasis-open.org/specGuidelines/ndr/namingDirectives.html#stage)

* Working Draft (WD) \[not approved, no official status\]
* Committee Specification Draft (CSD)
* Committee Specification Public Review Draft (CSPRD)
* Committee Specification (CS)
* Candidate OASIS Standard (COS)
* OASIS Standard (OS)
* *Final* Indicates an open-services.net OSLC specification that has not yet been migrated to OASIS.

Note: The open-services.net specifications that are being migrated to OASIS by the OSLC Domains TC are strictly a document maintenance exercise. That is, a *Final* open-service.net specification may appear as an OASIS CSD with different formatting, but will have the same specification normative content. Migration of these documents to OASIS will therefore have no impact on implementations. open-services.net specifications that do not yet have at least OASIS CSD status will reference the existing (PDF) open-services.net specification, and the status will be shown in *italics*.
