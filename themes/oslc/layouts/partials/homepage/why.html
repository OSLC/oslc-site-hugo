      The OSLC Core Specification is a Hypermedia API standard currently mainly adopted in software and systems engineering domains, 
      but with the potential to provide value to any domain with data integration challenges. The OSLC Core specifications expands 
      on the W3C LDP capabilities, to define the essential and common technical elements of OSLC domain specifications and offers 
      guidance on common concerns for creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources.

    <p class="intro--paragraph">
      OSLC domain-specific specifications define the equivalent of schemas in RDF for enabling data interoperability. They consist 
      of RDF vocabularies and OSLC resource shapes. RDF vocabularies are used to describe standardized resource types and properties.
      OSLC resource shapes are used to define constraints such as multiplicity constraints on properties of specific resource types.
