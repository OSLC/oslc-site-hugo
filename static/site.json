        "title": "OLSC Survey Provides Insights into Needs for Software Integration Standards",
        "content": "\nThe Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) steering committee is gathering feedback from the community to help shape the future vision and mission for OSLC. As part of that effort a survey of the community members was conducted and it highlights some interesting results about the needs of this group. You can find the full results of the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-2XVJT6CR/.\n\nOSLC is an open community that builds standards to solve a vexing problem: How to integrate the specialized software used by different types of software and systems development practitioners so teams and their tools can work together.\n\nFor example, it’s wildly inefficient for a software tester to file defect reports in her specialized QA software and then send an email to the development team to tell them about the defect so they can manually enter it into their Agile development management tools. There is no place for this type of carrier pigeon communication in today’s world of short development cycles and continuous delivery.\n\nA note about methodology: The survey was advertised via several OSLC-related communication channels and participants self-selected the survey rather than being a random sample. This means the results represent the opinions of that group and may not necessarily be representative of the opinions of the wider community.\n\nIntegration is desired for both Systems and Software\n\nThe first category in the chart above is “Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Tools/DevOps (e.g. Agile, Testing, Requirements, Continuous Integration, etc.) with over 70% of respondents indicating that this is of interest. Systems Engineering and Product Lifecycle Management were also identified as key areas of integration for the OSLC community. While not specifically asked in this survey, supporting the collaboration between SDLC and the world of Systems and Product Lifecycle Management is a key area where OSLC can be applied.\n\nTraceability is key\n\nNearly 80% of the participants identified “Traceability across tools” as a desired benefit of integrating tools. The second and third most common responses were “Requirements coordination with test planning” and “Developer collaboration with QA.” All three of these top responses require an element of traceability between the artifacts managed by each discipline. This is a need that OSLC’s linked data architecture is particularly well suited to address.\n\nHigher OSLC adoption is needed\n\nLike any standard, the benefits of adopting OSLC increase as more organizations adopt the standard. Before a standard is widely used, early adopters need to invest in supporting it to create the necessary critical mass. There are more than 50 known tools that can support OSLC either natively or through a third-party adapter. However, there is still a need for higher adoption and more native support for OSLC among non-IBM tools. The survey reflects this and highlights the “chicken and egg” dilemma, where higher industry adoption would be the primary motivator for the respondents’ organizations to adopt OSLC. With more than 50 tools already capable of supporting OSLC and more than 10 third-party adapter technologies, there is clearly a strong level of industry momentum. See below for more information on how to participate in the discussion on driving OSLC to the next level of adoption where “adoption” itself is no longer an impediment.\n\nIntegration is needed across a broad range of tools\n\nThe survey identified 55 different tools that respondents might have a need to integrate. Some 41 out of these 55 were selected by multiple people. It’s also interesting to note not only the diversity in products/vendors but also in the types of tools involved. The list includes tools for requirements, Agile development, QA/Testing, source code management, PLM, and Service Desk. Together this indicates a long tail of integration needs across a large set of tools. Again this highlights both the need and the potential benefits of a standardized integration approach.\n\nThe OSLC steering committee is always looking for more feedback to help improve integration through open technology. We welcome your comments at open-services.net forums and the OSLC LinkedIn Group.  Together, we can stop the insanity of carrier pigeon communication across teams and tools.",

The IBM tool Rational Team Concert was integrated with Teamcenter Enterprise from Siemens PLM. Rational Team Concert is used for managing the creation and delivery of documents which are needed for the authorisation of their products by European Union (EU) or local country bodies. The requirements are managed in Rational Doors Next Generation. The documents are stored in their central PDM system Teamcenter and linked to the RTC tasks. Teamcenter Enterprise doesn’t provide a native OSLC service and is now enabled by the OpenPDM OSLC Adapter to be accessed by RTC via OSLC. The project was defined, performed and finished successfully in close cooperation with IBM.\n\nFor more information see http://prostep.com ",

        "title": "OLSC Survey Provides Insights into Needs for Software Integration Standards",
        "content": "\nThe Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) steering committee is gathering feedback from the community to help shape the future vision and mission for OSLC. As part of that effort a survey of the community members was conducted and it highlights some interesting results about the needs of this group. You can find the full results of the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-2XVJT6CR/.\n\nOSLC is an open community that builds standards to solve a vexing problem: How to integrate the specialized software used by different types of software and systems development practitioners so teams and their tools can work together.\n\nFor example, it’s wildly inefficient for a software tester to file defect reports in her specialized QA software and then send an email to the development team to tell them about the defect so they can manually enter it into their Agile development management tools. There is no place for this type of carrier pigeon communication in today’s world of short development cycles and continuous delivery.\n\nA note about methodology: The survey was advertised via several OSLC-related communication channels and participants self-selected the survey rather than being a random sample. This means the results represent the opinions of that group and may not necessarily be representative of the opinions of the wider community.\n\nIntegration is desired for both Systems and Software\n\nThe first category in the chart above is “Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Tools/DevOps (e.g. Agile, Testing, Requirements, Continuous Integration, etc.) with over 70% of respondents indicating that this is of interest. Systems Engineering and Product Lifecycle Management were also identified as key areas of integration for the OSLC community. While not specifically asked in this survey, supporting the collaboration between SDLC and the world of Systems and Product Lifecycle Management is a key area where OSLC can be applied.\n\nTraceability is key\n\nNearly 80% of the participants identified “Traceability across tools” as a desired benefit of integrating tools. The second and third most common responses were “Requirements coordination with test planning” and “Developer collaboration with QA.” All three of these top responses require an element of traceability between the artifacts managed by each discipline. This is a need that OSLC’s linked data architecture is particularly well suited to address.\n\nHigher OSLC adoption is needed\n\nLike any standard, the benefits of adopting OSLC increase as more organizations adopt the standard. Before a standard is widely used, early adopters need to invest in supporting it to create the necessary critical mass. There are more than 50 known tools that can support OSLC either natively or through a third-party adapter. However, there is still a need for higher adoption and more native support for OSLC among non-IBM tools. The survey reflects this and highlights the “chicken and egg” dilemma, where higher industry adoption would be the primary motivator for the respondents’ organizations to adopt OSLC. With more than 50 tools already capable of supporting OSLC and more than 10 third-party adapter technologies, there is clearly a strong level of industry momentum. See below for more information on how to participate in the discussion on driving OSLC to the next level of adoption where “adoption” itself is no longer an impediment.\n\nIntegration is needed across a broad range of tools\n\nThe survey identified 55 different tools that respondents might have a need to integrate. Some 41 out of these 55 were selected by multiple people. It’s also interesting to note not only the diversity in products/vendors but also in the types of tools involved. The list includes tools for requirements, Agile development, QA/Testing, source code management, PLM, and Service Desk. Together this indicates a long tail of integration needs across a large set of tools. Again this highlights both the need and the potential benefits of a standardized integration approach.\n\nThe OSLC steering committee is always looking for more feedback to help improve integration through open technology. We welcome your comments at open-services.net forums and the OSLC LinkedIn Group.  Together, we can stop the insanity of carrier pigeon communication across teams and tools.",

It offers OSLC standard services, especially for those PLM systems which don’t offer native ones. The adapter is an add-on for the OpenPDM integration framework which provides connectors to a wide range of systems, e.g.:\n\nAnsys EKM\nAras Innovator\nAutodesk Vault\nDassault SmarTeam\nDassault ENOVIA V6\nDassault ENOVIA VPM V4\nMSC SimManager\nOracle Agile ePLM\nPTC Windchill\nSAP PLM\nSiemens Teamcenter Engineering\nSiemens Teamcenter Enterprise\nSiemens Teamcenter UA\nThe OpenPDM OSLC services can be integrated in any OSLC consuming applications. The supported features are:\n\nOSLC Service Providers  (OSLC Core 2.0)\nJazz specific Root Service\nChange Request Resources:\nas RDF/XML\nas JSON  (OSLC CM 2.0)\nQuery Capabilities (OSLC Core 2.0)\nSelection UI (OSLC Core 2.0)\nOAuth\nLink documents managed in Backend as related resource to OSLC CM entity\nProvide download for documents\nA very successful project was performed by PROSTEP at Bombardier Transportation. The IBM tool Rational Team Concert was integrated with Teamcenter Enterprise from Siemens PLM. Rational Team Concert is used for managing the creation and delivery of documents which are needed for the authorisation of their products by European Union (EU) or local country bodies. The requirements are managed in Rational Doors Next Generation. The documents are stored in their central PDM system Teamcenter and linked to the RTC tasks. Teamcenter Enterprise doesn’t provide a native OSLC service and is now enabled by the OpenPDM OSLC Adapter to be accessed by RTC via OSLC. The project was defined, performed and finished successfully in close cooperation with IBM.\n\nFor more information see http://prostep.com",

Now imagine how much more happy and productive an organization would be if all those tools could integrate via standard interfaces. In broad strokes, this is the goal of the OSLC community.\n\nRead\n",

        "content": "\nGet started with developing OSLC applications\n\n“OSL-whaaaat now?”\n\nOpen Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) is a community that writes specifications to integrate software. Learn more at Why develop OSLC applications and at our main site.\n\nFor a high-level overview of how to add OSLC support to software, we recommend our video \"Getting started on implementing OSLC\":\n\n{{ youtube -oXqudLmNMI }}\n\nThe description on YouTube includes a table of contents and links to references.\n\n Explore our tutorial\n\nFor a more detailed look at what goes into OSLC support, read through our tutorial \"Integrating Products with OSLC\", which walks you through building an adapter that adds OSLC support to the popular Bugzilla defect-tracking software.\n\nThe concepts in the tutorial are broadly applicable to other software.\n\nIf you're building an OSLC provider (in other words, software that outputs OSLC resources), you'll learn how to\n\nProvide Service Providers and catalogs\nRepresent Bugzilla bugs as OSLC Change Management resources\nProvide UI Previews\nProvide a delegated UI for finding existing bugs\nProvide a delegated UI for creating new bugs\nAllow software to programmatically create new bugs\n\nIf you're building an OSLC consumer application, you'll learn how to:\n\nLink to OSLC resources in another application and display previews\nFind, select, and create bugs without leaving the application with delegated UIs\nParse OSLC resources\nCreate new bugs automatically\n\nThe tutorial has working sample applications and detailed instructions for running them.\n\nWhy develop OSLC applications\n\nIntegrating software is hard; we want it to be easier. And we need your help.\n\nWe define standardized ways to represent common resources in software development (for example, a defect or a performance test). We also define standardized methods to allow other applications to access, display, preview, find, create, and update those resources.\n\nWith standardized resources and methods, any tool can access and manipulate the data and artifacts from any other compliant tool. So instead of a variety of fragile point-to-point integrations you have one common way to connect and integrate many products. It's not quite plug-and-play, but it's close.\n\nWe want OSLC to succeed because better and easier integrations will save everyone time and money. And we think that software with OSLC integration has a competitive advantage.\n\nDon't just take our word for it. Icaro Technologies estimated that they could have saved two million dollars over two years if they used OSLC standards for a project with more than 10 integrations. And major industry groups like SPRINT and EADS have decided that OSLC-compliant software can help them collaborate and verify requirements on highly complex products like commercial airplanes.\n\nOSLC specifications are free to adopt, and we want them to spread. So help us out!\n\n Technical foundations\n\nTo build software that supports OSLC, you should be familiar with the following concepts:\n\nLinked Data\n\nLinked data is the main technical foundation of all of our specifications. The video below provides a brief overview of the value of linked data and how we implement it with OSLC:\n\n{{ youtube 40mjwqGEKBU }}\n\nIf you're new to linked data and RDF, we've put together a playlist of videos that can help you catch up.\n\n RESTful web architecture and HTTP\n\nYou should be familiar with designing RESTful applications.\n\nFor a quick primer, we recommend “Learn REST” by Dr. M. Elkstein, particularly these sections:\n\nWhat is REST?\nREST as Lightweight Web Services\nHow Simple is REST?\nMore Complex REST Requests\nREST Server Responses\n\nFor OSLC implementations, you must use HTTP protocol.\n\nRDF, Turtle, JSON, and HTML\n\nWe require services and resources to be represented in RDF, but you might prefer to supplement that with a variety of machine-readable and human-readable formats like Turtle, JSON, or HTML.\n\nInstead of string parsing and regular expressions, you will definitely want to explore using an RDF parser such as Apache Jena.\n\n OAuth\n\nOSLC does not require OAuth, but it is the most common approach for managing authentication between clients.\n\nServices, resources and design patterns\n\nThe OSLC Core specification defines the basic patterns and protocols that any OSLC software must implement. The other workgroups define additional resources or extend existing ones, but they do not add new protocols.\n\nHere are the major resources defined in the OSLC Core specification:\n\n| Resource or Pattern | Description | More information |\n|----------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Service Provider | A resource that describes a collection of resources and tells you how to create new resources, find existing resources, or expose a user interface to do either | OSLC Primer: Service Provider |\n| Resource Paging | A pattern to break long lists of resources into smaller pages, and provide a URL for the next page | OSLC Primer: Resource Paging |\n| Queries | Standard query string patterns to retrieve a subset of resources or properties | OSLC Primer: Query mechanisms |\n| Resource Shapes | Documents that define and describe the properties a resources should have, including acceptable values, cardinality, and whether or not those properties are required | OSLC Primer: Resource Shapes |\n| Creation Factory | A service that creates new resources and (via HTTP POST) and may also provide the Resource Shape for new resources | Core 2.0: Creation Factories |\n| Service Provider Catalog | A resources that lists a set of ServiceProviders | OSLC Primer: ServiceProvider |\n| Delegated User Interface (UI) dialogs | A method for embedding an interface to create or find resources inside another tool | OSLC Primer: Delegated UI dialogs |\n| UI Previews | A method for discovering and displaying a preview of a resource in another tool | OSLC Primer: UI Preview |\n\nTo explore some of our other specifications, the OSLC Core Workgroup maintains a list of OSLC vocabularies and specifications that includes relationship diagrams.\n\n Tools & SDKs\n\nEclipse Lyo\n\nThe Eclipse Lyo project has a variety of tools to help you adopt OSLC specifications:\n\nOSLC4J: a Java SDK for OSLC providers and consumers that lets you define OSLC resources and convert them to Java objects\nPerl libraries and samples: modules for Perl for interacting with OSLC providers, including the Net-OSLC PERL library\nTest Suites: test if your OSLC applications complies with the requirements of our specifications\nTracked Resource Set SDK: a test suite, toolkit, and sample application for the Tracked Resource Set specification\n\nYou do not have to use the Eclipse application to use Eclipse Lyo: Although much of the documentation assumes you will be using Eclipse, the source code is available in a Git repository and much of it does not require the Eclipse application to work.\n\n Sample applications and code\n\nIf you'd like to explore some existing code, there are a variety of samples and existing applications available.\n\nThe Communications Workgroup has a list of Open Source OSLC projects (along with their licenses).\n\nIf you'd like to explore a basic application that provides OSLC Service Provider resources and UI previews, Vijay Kalangumvathakkal of developerWorks has some simple applications available to download and try out.\n\nOur tutorial walks you through a working adapter that adds OSLC Change Management support to Bugzilla and a simple consumer application.\n\nFinally, many of the software development kits include sample applications. The OSLC4J component of Eclipse Lyo has a variety of applications:\n\na stock quote sample applications\na Change Management provider\na Quality Management provider\nan Automation provider\nthe aforementioned Bugzilla Change Management adapter\n\nThe Lyo Client component in Eclipse Lyo includes additional APIs and sample code that addresses a variety of common OSLC use cases including login, OAuth, service discovery, and queries.\n\nThe OSLC4Net project includes sample applications if you favor .NET/C#.\n\nOSLC Open Source Node.js Projects\n\nEclipse/Lyo provides a set of Java based APIs and generative tools to support the creation of OSLC domain servers and integrated client applications. While Eclipse/Lyo provides a very rich and robust platfrom for OSLC development, it has a relatively high learning curve and that can increase development time, costs and risks.\n\nOSLC4JS represents a set of related Open Source projects supporting the creation and integration of OSLC based client and server applications that leverage the dynamic and asynchronous capabilities of JavaScript and Node.js. The LDP Service and OSLC Service projects provide Express.js middleware components that can be used to add LDP and/or OSLC services to any Express Web application. The OSLC Browser and OSLC Server projects use these services to create sample OSLC client and server apps that can easily and dynamically adapted to any OSLC domain, extensions to domains, and/or integrations between domains.\n\nOSLC4JS's goal is to minimize the cost of developing the OSLC specifications, reference implementation and test suites. The OASIS OSLC specifications would also benefit from a reference implementation in dynamic language such as JavaScript.\n\n The OSLC4JS Projects\n\nThe following sections provide a brief description of each OSLC4J sub-project and provide links to the development sites and related work products. The figure below shows the relationship between the modules created in the projects, and how they are assembled into a Web application.\n\nAdapter middleware in the figure represents some Express.js middleware component that provides CRUD access to some existing data source. This provides a simple way for vendors to provide OSLC access to their data sources without having to implement the details of OSLC and/or LDP.\n\nA oslc4js Slack Channel has been created to facilitate collaborative development of these Open Source Projects.\n\n| Project | Description | More information |\n|---------|------------ |------------------|\n| OSLC Browser | A sample OSLC Web application that uses the OSLC Service to provide a means of browsing OSLC resources. OSLC Browser allows you to configure a connection pool of contributing OSLC servers, and provides a convenient means of browsing the content contributed by those servers. The federation of thigs information is supported by the OSLC service with can also support OSLC domains, extension to domains, integration between domains. This allows the OSLC Browser to act as a federation hub for OSLC resources where stakeholder viewpoints, views (i.e., active dashboards) can be created to support integration needs. | Mural Design Wiki Track & Plan Bluemix App app route |\n| OSLC Client API | A simple Node.js asynchronous OSLC client API to facilitate rich application development in JavaScript. This API may be attractive to client developers who wish to access OSLC capabilities and resources through a more logical API abstraction rather than more raw REST services. | Wiki Track & Plan npm package|\n| OSLC Service | A generic Node.js Express middleware OSLC 3.0 service that can support any domain and can be easily adapted to any applicable data source. This services also utilizes the LDP Service. | Wiki Track & Plan npm package |\n| OSLC Server | A minimal OSLC server that uses the oslc-service and ldp-service and can be accessed using a browser REST client. An instance of this server is deployed to IBM Bluemix in order to provide a platform for OSLC experimentation and testing. | Wiki Track & Plan Bluemix App app route |\n| LDP App | A sample Linked Data Platform (LDP) Web application that uses the LDP Service and supports CRUD operations and a graph of linked data. | Wiki Track & Plan Bluemix App app route |\n| LDP Service | Express middleware providing LDP capabilities to Web apps, with storage of JSON-DL in MongoDB. | Wiki Track & Plan npm package |\n",

Therefore, only the most recent version of the vocabularies are listed here, and linked to by the various OSLC core and domain namespace URIs.\n\nNamespaces\n\n| Specification | Namespace | RDF Schema | HTML |\n|---------------|-----------|------------|------|\n| Core 3.0 | http://open-services.net/ns/core | core.rdf | Core 3.0 Vocabulary |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n|       |        |                    |             |\n\nSpecifications, Vocabularies and Constraints\n\nThe following sections include additional links that provides additional details on each of the OSLC vocabularies.\n\n Change Management\n\n...\n",

The term 'systems engineering' is used to describe the interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on the design and management of a system over the whole lifecycle.\n\nHF is the application of human factors methods to develop systems with an effective, comfortable and user friendly design. HF seeks to avoid HF issues which are typically problems in which humans do not work with the system in a way as expected thus negatively impacting the overall system performance. When properly applied at the design stage, HF reduces situations where the human does not act or behave as expected. \n\nThe discipline of HF involves many methods such as data collection, task analysis, cognitive task analysis, human error identification, situation awareness analysis and interface analysis techniques. The implementation of these methods and the results they produce must be orchestrated around the existing design process of a project. HF is multidisciplinary and takes place across the entire lifecycle. The implementation of methods can only be done with meaningful input from the system design and for maximum effect; the results must be fed back into that design.\n\nWiki : \nIssues: \nForum : \nWorkgroup leads : \n",
