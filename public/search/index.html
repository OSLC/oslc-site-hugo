As a newcomer to the OSLC community, you might have been pondering over one question, but too shy to ask it aloud:

 Why should I invest my time and effort into OSLC?

Great that you asked! There are many good reasons for you to embrace OSLC and the specific reasons depend on your role. If you are...

.. a Tool Vendor

As a tool vendor, you need to ensure that your customers can integrate your product with other tools in order to extract the most value from your product. While providing a REST API is a norm nowadays, a developer has to build an integration layer. As every REST API is different, it means extra time reading the documentation, extra time developing plumbing code to perform model transformation, and most importantly, all this needs to be done on a case basis, leading to point-to-point integrations.

OSLC allows you to provide:

a uniform self-descriptive REST API;
a linked data model based on standard domains, common in ALM/PLM (RM, QM, CCM, etc.), that you can tailor to your product;
exchange data in plain JSON with the clients that are not linked-data ready;
provide rich UIs from your tool for use in 3rd-party tools for seamless linked data workflow;
and many other features that your customers would appreciate.

A number of other products used in ALM/PLM already implement OSLC and your OSLC-enabled tool can integrate with many of them without extra development effort.

 ..  a Tool Buyer

As a tool buyer, you have a unique set of requirements towards your toolchain and for many reasons (technical, organisational, financial) a single-vendor solution might not be viable for you. Therefore, one of the most important criteria for procurement of the new software tools is their TCO including the integration costs. Most of the tools come with semi-open proprietary APIs that often lack documentation. Those APIs will incur considerable development costs, often involving highly specialised consultants with a deep knowledge of the tool in question.

Tools that come with an OSLC-based API will you to integrate them into your toolchain with less (or none, in many cases) development effort, while performing a deeper integration, at the workflow level.

OSLC reduces the complexity and risk of increasingly complex software infrastructures, and improves the value of software across a broader set of internal and external stakeholders. OSLC-based API is an experience truly free from a vendor lock-in.

.. a Tool User

As a tool user, you have to switch between a plethora of tools on a daily basis. You often don&#39;t see how their integration is done, but you feel that it&#39;s done poorly: updates showing up in other tools many hours later, integrations getting broken every other tool update, etc.

Well-implemented OSLC integrations mostly remain backwards-compatible even across major releases. Standardised OSLC APIs often allow vendors to provide a fully supported integration with many other OSLC-compliant tools out of the box. Finally, an OSLC integration can be performed not only at the level of two tool data models, but at the level of your workflow involving those tools. This is possible through the use of delegated UIs, which allow you to interact with another OSLC-compatible tool without leaving your current open tool!

The Open Services Communication User Group held its kickoff call on August 13. The team is positioned to highlight integration successes and communicate the benefits of OSLC. As one participant said &#34;Think of us as the newspaper for the city.&#34; This is a perfect analogy of our intent to be indespensible to the community we serve and relevant to the broader audience. The Communication User Group will aims to deliver value, grows our community and provides the news that you need.

The group is currently working on an initial charter and has started a 2015-2016 roadmap based on various industry events. Our deliverables will capture the benefits of integration, document your success stories and assist adoption. The minutes from our first call are available here on the wiki.

We can use your help! Please consider joining the Open Services Communication User Group. Joining is simple. Become a member of Open Services and select join from the Communication Work Group page. Since the CommWG is a User Group, you will not need to complete a Workgroup Participation Agreement (WPA). Since the group is part of Open-services.net, you do not need to join any other organization such as OASIS.

It is easy, it is free and it is fun.

Here is a few things you can do to join in the Open Services Communication:

              <div class="result-item" title="OLSC Survey Provides Insights into Needs for Software Integration Standards">
                <h1><a href="news/oslc-survey-provides-insights-software-integration-standards/"> OLSC Survey Provides Insights into Needs for Software Integration Standards </a></h1>
                <div class="content-paragraph"> 
The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) steering committee is gathering feedback from the community to help shape the future vision and mission for OSLC. As part of that effort a survey of the community members was conducted and it highlights some interesting results about the needs of this group. You can find the full results of the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-2XVJT6CR/.

OSLC is an open community that builds standards to solve a vexing problem: How to integrate the specialized software used by different types of software and systems development practitioners so teams and their tools can work together.

For example, it’s wildly inefficient for a software tester to file defect reports in her specialized QA software and then send an email to the development team to tell them about the defect so they can manually enter it into their Agile development management tools. There is no place for this type of carrier pigeon communication in today’s world of short development cycles and continuous delivery.

A note about methodology: The survey was advertised via several OSLC-related communication channels and participants self-selected the survey rather than being a random sample. This means the results represent the opinions of that group and may not necessarily be representative of the opinions of the wider community.

Integration is desired for both Systems and Software

The first category in the chart above is “Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Tools/DevOps (e.g. Agile, Testing, Requirements, Continuous Integration, etc.) with over 70% of respondents indicating that this is of interest. Systems Engineering and Product Lifecycle Management were also identified as key areas of integration for the OSLC community. While not specifically asked in this survey, supporting the collaboration between SDLC and the world of Systems and Product Lifecycle Management is a key area where OSLC can be applied.

Traceability is key

Nearly 80% of the participants identified “Traceability across tools” as a desired benefit of integrating tools. The second and third most common responses were “Requirements coordination with test planning” and “Developer collaboration with QA.” All three of these top responses require an element of traceability between the artifacts managed by each discipline. This is a need that OSLC’s linked data architecture is particularly well suited to address.

Higher OSLC adoption is needed

Like any standard, the benefits of adopting OSLC increase as more organizations adopt the standard. Before a standard is widely used, early adopters need to invest in supporting it to create the necessary critical mass. There are more than 50 known tools that can support OSLC either natively or through a third-party adapter. However, there is still a need for higher adoption and more native support for OSLC among non-IBM tools. The survey reflects this and highlights the “chicken and egg” dilemma, where higher industry adoption would be the primary motivator for the respondents’ organizations to adopt OSLC. With more than 50 tools already capable of supporting OSLC and more than 10 third-party adapter technologies, there is clearly a strong level of industry momentum. See below for more information on how to participate in the discussion on driving OSLC to the next level of adoption where “adoption” itself is no longer an impediment.

Integration is needed across a broad range of tools

The survey identified 55 different tools that respondents might have a need to integrate. Some 41 out of these 55 were selected by multiple people. It’s also interesting to note not only the diversity in products/vendors but also in the types of tools involved. The list includes tools for requirements, Agile development, QA/Testing, source code management, PLM, and Service Desk. Together this indicates a long tail of integration needs across a large set of tools. Again this highlights both the need and the potential benefits of a standardized integration approach.

The OSLC steering committee is always looking for more feedback to help improve integration through open technology. We welcome your comments at open-services.net forums and the OSLC LinkedIn Group.  Together, we can stop the insanity of carrier pigeon communication across teams and tools.

Open Services for Life-cycle Collaboration or OSLC defines a set of standard capabilities enabling loosely coupled, open and scalable point-to-point integration between heterogeneous software development tools. OSLC allows users to work seamlessly across their preferred tools and does not require complex interchange of data between tools that may result in information redundancy and maintenance issues.

The OASIS OSLC Core 3.0 Specifications represent the continued evolution of OSLC through collaborating organizations to provide the standards, APIs and tools that support integrated product, system and application lifecycle management.

                <div class="content-paragraph"> 
PROSTEP would like to announce to the OSLC community, that there is an OpenPDM OSLC Adapter which enables PLM systems to connect to the OSLC world. It offers OSLC standard services, especially for those PLM systems which don’t offer native ones. The adapter is an add-on for the OpenPDM integration framework which provides connectors to a wide range of systems, e.g.:

Ansys EKM
Aras Innovator
Autodesk Vault
Dassault SmarTeam
Dassault ENOVIA V6
Dassault ENOVIA VPM V4
MSC SimManager
Oracle Agile ePLM
PTC Windchill
SAP PLM
Siemens Teamcenter Engineering
Siemens Teamcenter Enterprise
Siemens Teamcenter UA
The OpenPDM OSLC services can be integrated in any OSLC consuming applications. The supported features are:

OSLC Service Providers  (OSLC Core 2.0)
Jazz specific Root Service
Change Request Resources:
as RDF/XML
as JSON  (OSLC CM 2.0)
Query Capabilities (OSLC Core 2.0)
Selection UI (OSLC Core 2.0)
OAuth
Link documents managed in Backend as related resource to OSLC CM entity
Provide download for documents
A very successful project was performed by PROSTEP at Bombardier Transportation. The IBM tool Rational Team Concert was integrated with Teamcenter Enterprise from Siemens PLM. Rational Team Concert is used for managing the creation and delivery of documents which are needed for the authorisation of their products by European Union (EU) or local country bodies. The requirements are managed in Rational Doors Next Generation. The documents are stored in their central PDM system Teamcenter and linked to the RTC tasks. Teamcenter Enterprise doesn’t provide a native OSLC service and is now enabled by the OpenPDM OSLC Adapter to be accessed by RTC via OSLC. The project was defined, performed and finished successfully in close cooperation with IBM.

                <h1><a href="news/updated-design-rolling-out-gradually/"> Pardon our dust: updated design rolling out gradually </a></h1>
                <div class="content-paragraph"> 
As I mentioned almost a year ago, I’ve been plugging away at a new look and feel for this site. I have a project on GitHub; you can open issues or discuss the direction in general; you can look at proposed sample pages.

And as of today, you’ll be able to see how it looks live. I’ll be rolling out elements of it gradually. There are a number of moving parts and I want to test thoroughly.

You can see what areas have the new design in this issue on GitHub. For the areas that have been updated, you should see the following:

A cleaner, simpler design: I’m pretty proud of this! It should be easier to read and navigate
Much faster page loading: I’ve pulled out all the stops to make sure that everything loads quickly and pages stay responsive. Speaking of…
Looks good everywhere: The design is fully “responsive”, so it’ll look and work great everywhere, from your phone to your workstation.
Improved accessibility for keyboard users and screen readers.
I will update this post on an ongoing basis with other highlights.

If you see something that looks busted, message me on Twitter, open a new issue, or email me.

Some more complicated pages like the Home page will come later. Right now I do not have plans to refresh the wiki or the forums; however, they will continue to function perfectly well as-is.

Thank you in advance for you patience, and I hope you enjoy the new look!

  &#34;futureAction&#34; .
  &#34;A predicate that links to an action that is not currently executable on the subject resource, \n\t\tbut may be executable in the future and/or on other resources. \n\t\tFor example, in OSLC Automation this is expected to link from an oslc_auto:AutomationPlan to an \n\t\toslc:Action resource with zero bindings (as it is not executable), \n\t\twith the meaning that the executable form of the action may be available on oslc_auto:AutomationResult resources \n\t\tgenerated by executing that Automation Plan.  Similarly, resource shapes can allow discovery of actions\n\t\tavailable on the output of a creation factory.\n\t\t&#34; .
   .

		This shape describes resources that are of the RDF type given by the object of the oslc:describes predicate. Formally, a shape S applies to a resource R if there is a triple R rdf:type T and there is a triple S oslc:describes T.
		
		
	

	
		
		property
		The properties that are allowed or required by this shape.
		
	

	

	
		
		allowedValue
		value allowed for a property.
		
	

	
	
	
		
		allowedValues
		Resource with allowed values for the property being defined. Range of oslc:AllowedValues
		
		
	

	
		
		defaultValue
		A default value for property, inlined into property definition.
		
	

	
		
		hidden
		A hint that indicates that property MAY be hidden when presented in a user interface.
		
	

	
		
		isMemberProperty
		Used to define when a property is a member of a container, useful for query.
		
	

	
		
		name
		Name of property being defined, i.e. second part of property&#39;s Prefixed Name.
		
	

	
		
		maxSize
		For String properties only, specifies maximum characters allowed. If not set, then there is no maximum or maximum is specified elsewhere.
		
	

	
		
		occurs
		MUST be either http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one, http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one, http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many or http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many.
		
	

	
		
		propertyDefinition
		URI of the property whose usage is being described.
		
	

	
		
		range
		For properties with a resource value-type, Providers MAY also specify the range of possible resource types allowed, each specified by URI. The default range is http://open-services.net/ns/core#Any.
		
	

	
		
		readOnly
		true if the property is read-only. If omitted, or set to false, then the property is writable. Providers SHOULD declare a property read-only when changes to the value of that property will not be accepted after the resource has been created, e.g. on PUT/PATCH requests. Consumers should note that the converse does not apply: Providers MAY reject a change to the value of a writable property.
		
	

	
		
		representation
		Should be http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference, http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline or http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either
		
	

	
		
		valueType
		A URI that indicates the value type, for example XML Schema or RDF URIs for literal value types, and OSLC-specified for others.  If this property is omitted, then the value type is unconstrained.
		
	

	
		
		valueShape
		if the value-type is a resource type, then Property MAY provide a shape value to indicate the Resource Shape that applies to the resource.
		
	

	
	
		
		smallPreview
		URI and sizing properties for an HTML document to be used for a small preview.
		
	
	
	
		
		largePreview
		URI and sizing properties for an HTML document to be used for a large preview.
		
	

	
	
		
		document
		The URI of an HTML document to be used for the preview.
		
		

	
		
		initialHeight
		Recommended initial height of the preview. The presence of this property indicates that the preview supports dynamically computing its size. Values MUST be expressed in relative length units as defined in the W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1). Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size). 
		
		

	
	
		
		Resource
		Resource: value is a resource at a specified URI (i.e. a URI Reference).
		
	

	
		
		LocalResource
		Local Resource: value is an resource available only inside the resource being defined (i.e. a Blank Node).
		
	

	
		
		AnyResource
		AnyResource: value is either a Resource or Local Resource.
		
	

	
	
		
		Reference
		A URI Reference representation to a resource.
		
	

	
		
		Inline
		An inline (RDF blank node) representation.
		
	

	
		
		Either
		Representations is either a URI reference or blank node.
		
	

	
	
		
		Exactly-one
		Property with value is required.
		
	

	
		
		Zero-or-one
		Property is optional and single valued.
		
	

	
		
		Zero-or-many
		Property is optional and multi-valued.
		
	

	
		
		One-or-many
		Property is required and multi-valued.
		
	

	
	
		
		Any
		Any value type is allowed.
		
	

	
	
		
		default
		Used in conjunction with oslc:usage property used to identify
		which service is the default usage.
		
	

	
	
		
		futureAction
		A predicate that links to an action that is not currently executable on the subject resource, 
		but may be executable in the future and/or on other resources. 
		For example, in OSLC Automation this is expected to link from an oslc_auto:AutomationPlan to an 
		oslc:Action resource with zero bindings (as it is not executable), 
		with the meaning that the executable form of the action may be available on oslc_auto:AutomationResult resources 
		generated by executing that Automation Plan.  Similarly, resource shapes can allow discovery of actions
		available on the output of a creation factory.
		
		
		
	

	
		
		executes
		Link from a currently available action to the future action it realizes.

Most large organizations require dozens and sometimes hundreds of specialized software tools to manage the lifecycle of the physical products or software applications they create. It isn&#39;t hard to imagine the monumental waste these organizations incur in attempting to manually coordinate the efforts of the teams that use these many disparate tools to create a single product. Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) is an open community for creating specifications for integrating lifecycle activities across tools to address this problem. Now imagine how much more happy and productive an organization would be if all those tools could integrate via standard interfaces. In broad strokes, this is the goal of the OSLC community.

“OSL-whaaaat now?”

Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) is a community that writes specifications to integrate software. Learn more at Why develop OSLC applications and at our main site.

For a high-level overview of how to add OSLC support to software, we recommend our video &#34;Getting started on implementing OSLC&#34;:

{{ youtube -oXqudLmNMI }}

The description on YouTube includes a table of contents and links to references.

 Explore our tutorial

For a more detailed look at what goes into OSLC support, read through our tutorial &#34;Integrating Products with OSLC&#34;, which walks you through building an adapter that adds OSLC support to the popular Bugzilla defect-tracking software.

The concepts in the tutorial are broadly applicable to other software.

If you&#39;re building an OSLC provider (in other words, software that outputs OSLC resources), you&#39;ll learn how to

Provide Service Providers and catalogs
Represent Bugzilla bugs as OSLC Change Management resources
Provide UI Previews
Provide a delegated UI for finding existing bugs
Provide a delegated UI for creating new bugs
Allow software to programmatically create new bugs

If you&#39;re building an OSLC consumer application, you&#39;ll learn how to:

Link to OSLC resources in another application and display previews
Find, select, and create bugs without leaving the application with delegated UIs
Parse OSLC resources
Create new bugs automatically

The tutorial has working sample applications and detailed instructions for running them.

Why develop OSLC applications

Integrating software is hard; we want it to be easier. And we need your help.

We define standardized ways to represent common resources in software development (for example, a defect or a performance test). We also define standardized methods to allow other applications to access, display, preview, find, create, and update those resources.

With standardized resources and methods, any tool can access and manipulate the data and artifacts from any other compliant tool. So instead of a variety of fragile point-to-point integrations you have one common way to connect and integrate many products. It&#39;s not quite plug-and-play, but it&#39;s close.

We want OSLC to succeed because better and easier integrations will save everyone time and money. And we think that software with OSLC integration has a competitive advantage.

Don&#39;t just take our word for it. Icaro Technologies estimated that they could have saved two million dollars over two years if they used OSLC standards for a project with more than 10 integrations. And major industry groups like SPRINT and EADS have decided that OSLC-compliant software can help them collaborate and verify requirements on highly complex products like commercial airplanes.

OSLC specifications are free to adopt, and we want them to spread. So help us out!

 Technical foundations

To build software that supports OSLC, you should be familiar with the following concepts:

Linked Data

Linked data is the main technical foundation of all of our specifications. The video below provides a brief overview of the value of linked data and how we implement it with OSLC:

{{ youtube 40mjwqGEKBU }}

If you&#39;re new to linked data and RDF, we&#39;ve put together a playlist of videos that can help you catch up.

 RESTful web architecture and HTTP

You should be familiar with designing RESTful applications.

For a quick primer, we recommend “Learn REST” by Dr. M. Elkstein, particularly these sections:

What is REST?
REST as Lightweight Web Services
How Simple is REST?
More Complex REST Requests
REST Server Responses

For OSLC implementations, you must use HTTP protocol.

RDF, Turtle, JSON, and HTML

We require services and resources to be represented in RDF, but you might prefer to supplement that with a variety of machine-readable and human-readable formats like Turtle, JSON, or HTML.

Instead of string parsing and regular expressions, you will definitely want to explore using an RDF parser such as Apache Jena.

 OAuth

OSLC does not require OAuth, but it is the most common approach for managing authentication between clients.

Services, resources and design patterns

The OSLC Core specification defines the basic patterns and protocols that any OSLC software must implement. The other workgroups define additional resources or extend existing ones, but they do not add new protocols.

Here are the major resources defined in the OSLC Core specification:

| Resource or Pattern | Description | More information |
|----------|----------------------|--------------------|
| Service Provider | A resource that describes a collection of resources and tells you how to create new resources, find existing resources, or expose a user interface to do either | OSLC Primer: Service Provider |
| Resource Paging | A pattern to break long lists of resources into smaller pages, and provide a URL for the next page | OSLC Primer: Resource Paging |
| Queries | Standard query string patterns to retrieve a subset of resources or properties | OSLC Primer: Query mechanisms |
| Resource Shapes | Documents that define and describe the properties a resources should have, including acceptable values, cardinality, and whether or not those properties are required | OSLC Primer: Resource Shapes |
| Creation Factory | A service that creates new resources and (via HTTP POST) and may also provide the Resource Shape for new resources | Core 2.0: Creation Factories |
| Service Provider Catalog | A resources that lists a set of ServiceProviders | OSLC Primer: ServiceProvider |
| Delegated User Interface (UI) dialogs | A method for embedding an interface to create or find resources inside another tool | OSLC Primer: Delegated UI dialogs |
| UI Previews | A method for discovering and displaying a preview of a resource in another tool | OSLC Primer: UI Preview |

To explore some of our other specifications, the OSLC Core Workgroup maintains a list of OSLC vocabularies and specifications that includes relationship diagrams.

 Tools &amp; SDKs

Eclipse Lyo

The Eclipse Lyo project has a variety of tools to help you adopt OSLC specifications:

OSLC4J: a Java SDK for OSLC providers and consumers that lets you define OSLC resources and convert them to Java objects
Perl libraries and samples: modules for Perl for interacting with OSLC providers, including the Net-OSLC PERL library
Test Suites: test if your OSLC applications complies with the requirements of our specifications
Tracked Resource Set SDK: a test suite, toolkit, and sample application for the Tracked Resource Set specification

You do not have to use the Eclipse application to use Eclipse Lyo: Although much of the documentation assumes you will be using Eclipse, the source code is available in a Git repository and much of it does not require the Eclipse application to work.

 Sample applications and code

If you&#39;d like to explore some existing code, there are a variety of samples and existing applications available.

The Communications Workgroup has a list of Open Source OSLC projects (along with their licenses).

If you&#39;d like to explore a basic application that provides OSLC Service Provider resources and UI previews, Vijay Kalangumvathakkal of developerWorks has some simple applications available to download and try out.

Our tutorial walks you through a working adapter that adds OSLC Change Management support to Bugzilla and a simple consumer application.

Finally, many of the software development kits include sample applications. The OSLC4J component of Eclipse Lyo has a variety of applications:

a stock quote sample applications
a Change Management provider
a Quality Management provider
an Automation provider
the aforementioned Bugzilla Change Management adapter

The Lyo Client component in Eclipse Lyo includes additional APIs and sample code that addresses a variety of common OSLC use cases including login, OAuth, service discovery, and queries.

The OSLC4Net project includes sample applications if you favor .NET/C#.

OSLC Open Source Node.js Projects

Eclipse/Lyo provides a set of Java based APIs and generative tools to support the creation of OSLC domain servers and integrated client applications. While Eclipse/Lyo provides a very rich and robust platfrom for OSLC development, it has a relatively high learning curve and that can increase development time, costs and risks.

OSLC4JS represents a set of related Open Source projects supporting the creation and integration of OSLC based client and server applications that leverage the dynamic and asynchronous capabilities of JavaScript and Node.js. The LDP Service and OSLC Service projects provide Express.js middleware components that can be used to add LDP and/or OSLC services to any Express Web application. The OSLC Browser and OSLC Server projects use these services to create sample OSLC client and server apps that can easily and dynamically adapted to any OSLC domain, extensions to domains, and/or integrations between domains.

OSLC4JS&#39;s goal is to minimize the cost of developing the OSLC specifications, reference implementation and test suites. The OASIS OSLC specifications would also benefit from a reference implementation in dynamic language such as JavaScript.

 The OSLC4JS Projects

The following sections provide a brief description of each OSLC4J sub-project and provide links to the development sites and related work products. The figure below shows the relationship between the modules created in the projects, and how they are assembled into a Web application.

Adapter middleware in the figure represents some Express.js middleware component that provides CRUD access to some existing data source. This provides a simple way for vendors to provide OSLC access to their data sources without having to implement the details of OSLC and/or LDP.

A oslc4js Slack Channel has been created to facilitate collaborative development of these Open Source Projects.

| Project | Description | More information |
|---------|------------ |------------------|
| OSLC Browser | A sample OSLC Web application that uses the OSLC Service to provide a means of browsing OSLC resources. OSLC Browser allows you to configure a connection pool of contributing OSLC servers, and provides a convenient means of browsing the content contributed by those servers. The federation of thigs information is supported by the OSLC service with can also support OSLC domains, extension to domains, integration between domains. This allows the OSLC Browser to act as a federation hub for OSLC resources where stakeholder viewpoints, views (i.e., active dashboards) can be created to support integration needs. | Mural Design Wiki Track &amp; Plan Bluemix App app route |
| OSLC Client API | A simple Node.js asynchronous OSLC client API to facilitate rich application development in JavaScript. This API may be attractive to client developers who wish to access OSLC capabilities and resources through a more logical API abstraction rather than more raw REST services. | Wiki Track &amp; Plan npm package|
| OSLC Service | A generic Node.js Express middleware OSLC 3.0 service that can support any domain and can be easily adapted to any applicable data source. This services also utilizes the LDP Service. | Wiki Track &amp; Plan npm package |
| OSLC Server | A minimal OSLC server that uses the oslc-service and ldp-service and can be accessed using a browser REST client. An instance of this server is deployed to IBM Bluemix in order to provide a platform for OSLC experimentation and testing. | Wiki Track &amp; Plan Bluemix App app route |
| LDP App | A sample Linked Data Platform (LDP) Web application that uses the LDP Service and supports CRUD operations and a graph of linked data. | Wiki Track &amp; Plan Bluemix App app route |

OSLC4JS is a set of related open source projects that support the creation and integration of Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC)-based client and server applications that leverage JavaScript and Node.js capabilities. OSLC4JS projects cover the complete end-to-end capabilities required to build, extend, and integrate web apps that exploit OSLC integration capabilities and linked data resources.

Why should I contribute?

Because you’ll see a lot of benefits. Developers will find that it makes it easy to add OSLC capabilities to any Node or Express Web application, including client and server components of that application. It will help you extend and integrate OSLC applications to support end-user scenarios and comprehensive cross-tool governance.

Overview

(this section is informative)

The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative is
creating a family of web services specifications for products, services
and other tools that support all phases of the software and product
lifecycle. The purpose of these specifications is to enable integration
between products that support Application Life-cycle Management (ALM)
and Product Life-cycle Management (PLM). Each part of the lifecycle or
domain has its own group and specification, for example there are Change
Management, Quality Management, Estimation &amp; Measurement and more. Each
of the domain specifications are built upon this core specification.

This OSLC Core Specification sets out the common features that every
OSLC Service can be expected to support using terminology from the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C). New terminology that we introduce can be
found in the glossary section below. This specification is mostly about
OSLC Services, it specifies what OSLC Services MUST, SHOULD and MAY do.
It also contains some required behaviors for OSLC clients and rules for
OSLC domain specifications that extend this specification.

OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that
describes the Services offered. Each Service can provide Creation
Factories for resource creation, Query Capabilities for resource query
and Delegated UI Dialogs to enable clients to create and select
resources via a web UI. Query Capabilities and Creation Factories may
offer Resource Shapes that describe the properties of resources managed
by the service. This is illustrated in the diagram below. See the
section below on Service Provider Resources for further discussion of
these concepts.

Figure \#1: OSLC Core Specification concepts and relationships

&lt;img alt=&#34;Diagram of OSLC concepts&#34;
src=&#34;/img/specifications/core-2.0/oslc-core-overview.png&#34;/

This specification establishes terminology and rules for defining
resources in terms of the property names and value-types that are
allowed and required. OSLC domain specifications are expected to use
these rules and terminologies to describe their resources. See the OSLC
Defined Resources section for more on this topic.

This specification also sets out rules for creating resource
representations in RDF/XML, JSON, Atom and Turtle formats. OSLC domain
specifications are expected to refer to these rules when specifying how
their resources are to be represented. See the OSLC Defined Resource
Representations section for the representation rules and examples of
each format.

\#AboutTheVersionNumber About the version number. We use the version
number &#34;2.0&#34; even though there has never been an OSLC Core Version 1.0
specification. We do this because this OSLC Core specification was
written after a series of version 1.0 domain specifications were
finalized by OSLC workgroups. The version 2.0 domain specifications will
all be based on this Core specification and to avoid confusion this
specification will also be known as Version 2.0.

About RDF. The resource and property-based data model used in OSLC
resources is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and OSLC
requires RDF representations, but OSLC uses a small number of RDF
concepts and does not require implementers to provide an RDF
triple-store or a SPARQL query-engine.

Design considerations
---------------------

The core philosophies of OSLC are to build on the powerful and scalable
architecture of the World Wide Web and to do the simplest possible
things that will work.

Build on the WWW. OSLC builds on the architecture of the WWW and
follows the REST architectural pattern. This means that OSLC Services
provide a uniform HTTP interface, OSLC URIs are stable and opaque and,
in simple terms, OSLC works like the web.

Keep things simple. Doing the simplest things that will possibly
work means a couple of different things in regard to OSLC. It means
starting with simple and existing concepts. For example, we model
everything as resources with property values and do not stray from that
model. Keeping things simple also means building on established and
well-known specifications, but also carefully limiting the number of
other specifications that we reference. This simplicity is intended to
enable loose coupling and to make life easier for everybody: OSLC domain
work groups, OSLC Service implementers and OSLC client developers.

Accommodate different schemas. Because of the breadth of the OSLC
domains, spanning lifecycle and platforms, OSLC has to work for systems
with very different data schemas or no schemas at all. Flexibility is
needed, but some OSLC Services must be able to offer information about
resource properties so that clients can learn which are allowed and
required for resource creation, query and reporting.

Accommodate different representations. Different client platforms
might require or at least prefer different representations. For example,
in the browser a JSON or Atom format representation might work best.
OSLC Services will all support RDF/XML and may support other formats
including JSON, Atom and Turtle.

Align with the W3C Linked Data initiative. Instead of defining a new
data model, OSLC’s resource and property-value approach is based on
industry standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model. This
model allows OSLC to keep things simple, build on the WWW and
accommodate different schemas.

Glossary of terms
-----------------

This is a guide to some of the terminology used in this document. The
following definitions are standard W3C concepts. OSLC uses these
concepts without modification – their definitions are summarized here
for the convenience of the reader. See http://www.w3c.org.

Resource: A network data object or service that can be
    identified by a URI. Resources may be available in multiple
    representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats,
    size, resolutions) or vary in other ways. (reference: HTTP)

!-- --

Representation: An HTTP payload entity, included in an HTTP
    response, that is subject to content negotiation. There may exist
    multiple representations. associated with a particular HTTP
    response status. (reference: HTTP)

!-- --

URI: Uniform Resource Identifiers are simply formatted strings
    which identify--via name, location, or any other characteristic -- a
    resource (reference: URI Syntax)

Here are the OSLC specific terms used in this specification.

(these definitions are normative)

OSLC Domain: an OSLC Domain is one ALM or PLM topic area such as
    Change Management, Requirements management or Automation. Each OSLC
    Domain will have its own OSLC specification that complies with this
    Core specification.

!-- --

OSLC Service: a set of capabilities that enable a web client to
    create, retrieve, update and delete resources managed by an ALM or
    PLM product or online service offering and associated with one
    OSLC Domain.

!-- --

OSLC Service Provider: a product or online service offering that
    provides an implementation of one or more OSLC Services, which may
    themselves implement different OSLC Domain specifications.

!-- --

OSLC Resource: a resource that is managed by an OSLC Service,
    may have properties and may link to other resources including those
    provided by other OSLC Services.

!-- --

OSLC Defined Resource: a resource that is defined by an OSLC
    specification, see OSLC Defined Resources below.

!-- --

OSLC Defined Properties: resource properties that are defined by
    an OSLC specification, defined by an OSLC Resource Shape or both.

!-- --

OSLC Resource Shape: defines the set of OSLC Properties expected
    in a resource for specific operations (i.e. creation, update
    or query) for each their value types, allowed values, cardinality
    and optionality. Examples of such operations include OSLC Creation
    Resource and Query Resource. Other examples might include
    applications that display data in tables.

!-- --

OSLC Creation Factory. A creation factory provides a URI used to
    create new resources via HTTP POST and may also provide Resource
    Shapes that describe the types of resources that may be created.

!-- --

OSLC Query Capability: A query capability provides a base
    URI for forming query resource URIs and, optionally, Resource Shapes
    that describe the property values that may be used in query
    expressions and returned in query results.

!-- --

OSLC Response Info Resource: An OSLC Defined Resource that
    provides information about a paged resource representation, e.g. the
    next page in a multi-page query result representation.

Here are some industry terms that we use in this specification:

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM): ALM is the marriage of
    business management to software engineering made possible by tools
    that facilitate and integrate requirements management, architecture,
    coding, testing, tracking, and release management
    (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicationlifecyclemanagement).
Product Lifecycle Management (PLM): In industry, product
    lifecycle management (PLM) is the process of managing the entire
    lifecycle of a product from its conception, through design and
    manufacture, to service and disposal (from
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productlifecyclemanagement).

And finally, we use the following two terms to describe portions of the
OSLC Core specification:

Normative. Normative sections of this document set forth
    requirements that must be met to establish conformance with the OSLC
    Core specification; or providing recommendations or optional courses
    of action. This is done using use words from
    RFC-2119 (e.g. MUST, SHOULD,
    MAY, etc.). For recommended or optional features, conformance is not
    dependent on the fact of implementation, but, if implemented, that
    implementation is as prescribed in this specification. Contrast
    with informative.

!-- --

Informative. Informative text provides background
    or explanation. Contrast with Normative. It should be clear which
    sentences and paragraphs are informative from the context and the
    absence of RFC-2119 keywords. Sections that are purely informative
    will be marked as informative. Informative text that might be
    mistaken for normative will also be marked.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

OSLC Defined Resources

An OSLC Resource is a resource managed by an OSLC Service. An OSLC
Resource is typically something like a Change Request, a Requirement or
some other ALM or PLM artifact or record, but an OSLC Resource could
also be a video or a presentation file. The resource’s storage medium is
unconstrained by OSLC, e.g. it could be stored in a relational database,
a flat-file on disk, a source code control system, or in any other way.

An OSLC Service can manage any type of resource; OSLC specifications
only constrain an OSLC Service’s behavior with respect to resource types
it manages that are defined by OSLC specifications (OSLC Defined
Resources). OSLC Defined Resources may be specified in any OSLC
specification, including this document. Resources are defined by the
properties that are allowed and required in the resource.

OSLC Defined Resources
----------------------

OSLC uses a simple model of resources with property values intended to
be consistent with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model
(reference: RDF Concepts). OSLC also builds upon the Extensible Markup
Language (XML) namespace mechanism (reference: XML Namespaces).

When specifying a resource or a property, OSLC Specifications define its
type as a URI which can be decomposed into a namespace URI and a name.
We abbreviate type URIs as Prefixed Names (reference: Prefixed Names),
which are represented in XML as QNames. The namespace used for resources
defined in this specification is defined as follows:

Namespace URI: http://open-services.net/ns/core#
Default Prefix: oslc

When defining an OSLC Resource type, OSLC Specifications MUST
provide the following information:

Name (String): name of the resource which MUST be valid as
    the Local Name part of a QName (reference: XML Namespaces).
URI (URI): The URI of the resource definition. Per the rules of
    Prefixed Names, this URI is formed by appending the Name to the end
    of the Namespace URI in the specification that defines the resource.
    For example, the resource named Service (defined below) gets the
    Type URI of http://open-services.net/ns/core#Service.

Once a resource type is defined, its allowed and required properties can
be defined.

Regardless of any property definitions, providers and clients MAY impose
implementation-specific limits on resources they accept. For example,
they are not required to accept/create/store resources whose RDF triples
contain objects with arbitrarily large literal values.

Defining OSLC Properties

OSLC Specifications MAY provide a list of properties allowed and/or
required for a particular domain and operation on an OSLC Defined
Resource; if no operation is specified, then the list &amp;lt;br
/&amp;gt;applies to all operations governed by that specification.
Specifications that provide a list of properties and constraints on them
SHOULD provide the following information for each property that they
define.

Name: name of the property which MUST be valid as the Local
    Name part of a QName (reference: XML Namespaces).
URI: The URI that identifies the property. The URI is formed by
    appending the Name to the end of the Namespace URI associated with
    the property. For example, the resource named
    oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog (defined below in the Service
    Providers Section) defines a property named domain with the URI of
    http://open-services.net/ns/coredomain
Description: Description of the property.
Occurs: value MUST be one of:
    [ http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one
        ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one)
    [ http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one
        ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one)
    [ http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many
        ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many)
    [ http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many
        ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many)
Value-types: A property MAY allow multiple value-types and a
    value MUST satisfy one or more of them. Each value-type MUST
    be a URI that corresponds to one of the following:
    Literal value-types:
        Boolean: a boolean type as specified by XSD Boolean (
            http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean, reference:
            XSD Datatypes).
        DateTime: a Date and Time type as specified by XSD
            dateTime ( http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime,
            reference: XSD Datatypes).
        Decimal: a decimal number type as specified by XSD
            Decimal ( http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal,

            by XSD Double ( http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double,
            reference: XSD Datatypes).
        Float: a floating-point number type as specified by XSD
            Float ( http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float, reference:

            reference: XSD Datatypes).
        String: a string type as specified by XSD String (
            http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string, reference:
            XSD Datatypes).
        XMLLiteral: a Literal XML value ( [
            http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral
            ](http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral)).
    Resource value-types:
        Resource: value is a resource at a specified URI (i.e. a
            URI Reference) ( [
            http://open-services.net/ns/core#Resource
            ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Resource) ).
        Local Resource: value is an resource available only
            inside the resource being defined (i.e. a Blank Node) ( [
            http://open-services.net/ns/core#LocalResource
            ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#LocalResource) ).
        AnyResource: value is either a Resource or **Local
            Resource** as defined above ( [
            http://open-services.net/ns/core#AnyResource
            ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#AnyResource) ).
Representation: for properties with a resource value-type, OSLC
    specifications should also specify how the resource will
    be represented. The options are [
    http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference
    ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference) , [
    http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline
    ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline) or [
    http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either
    ](http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either).
Range: for properties with a resource value-type, OSLC
    specifications should follow the best practices in [Appendix C
    Guidance on Links and Relationships](OslcCoreSpecAppendixLinks),
    which usually results in no restrictions on the range of possible
    resource types allowed, and an informative recommendation in the
    property description suggesting which resource types implementations
    should expect to find. This can be specified as a list of one or
    more resource types specified by URI reference; when no restrictions
    are required, use the string any. Clients SHOULD allow any resource
    type as the target of a link. Providers are strongly RECOMMENDED
    to behave reasonably for all resource types listed in a property’s
    description, and to degrade gracefully for others, as defined in
    Appendix C.
Read-only: Boolean indication of whether or not clients are
    permitted to replace the property’s value after the resource has
    been created. Allowable values are: true, false, unspecified.
    True indicates that providers SHOULD NOT permit clients
        to change the property’s value after the resource has
        been created.
    False indicates that providers MAY permit clients to
        change the property’s value after the resource has been created.
    Unspecified indicates that the domain specification leaves
        the choice up to provider implementations.

In the rest of this document we will define OSLC resources as described
above. The below section titled OSLC Defined Resource Representations
defines how OSLC resources are to be represented in RDF/XML, JSON and
other formats.

OSLC Services that wish to provide the information above in a
machine-readable format MAY use OSLC Resource Shapes, see [Appendix
A: Common Properties and Resources](OSLC Core Spec Appendix A) for more
information.

NOTE: we do not mention Internationalization of strings here because we
expect standard HTTP content-negotiation and representation (e.g.
xml:lang) mechanisms to be used for such.

Unknown properties and content
------------------------------

For OSLC Defined Resources, clients SHOULD assume that an OSLC
Service will discard unknown property values. An OSLC Service MAY
discard property values that are not part of the resource definition or
Resource Shape known by the server. If a client needs verification that
the requested update was accepted it SHOULD note the HTTP response
header ETag value returned with the HTTP PUT, Immediately HTTP GET the
resource back and compare the HTTP response header ETag value and
contents with its expectations. The Service SHOULD NOT return an
error code for unrecognized content. A Service MUST return an error
code if recognized content is invalid.

The rule is different for clients. When doing an update, OSLC clients
MUST preserve any unknown property-values and other content in OSLC
Defined Resources.

See following section on Resource Update.

Resource Operations
-------------------

OSLC Services use HTTP for create, retrieve, update and delete
operations on resources. OSLC Services MUST comply with the HTTP
specification (reference: HTTP).

Resource Creation

(this section is informative)

To create an OSLC Defined Resource, or any type of resource managed by
an OSLC Service, an OSLC client HTTP POSTs a representation of that
resource to a Creation URI. See the section on [Creation
Factories](Creation_Factories) for more information.

Resource Removal

(this section is informative)

To delete an OSLC Defined Resource, or any type of resource managed by a
service, a client performs an HTTP DELETE on the resource&#39;s URI.

 Resource Update

To update an OSLC Resource in an OSLC Service, a client fetches a
representation of that resource via HTTP GET. The client updates the
representation and then uses HTTP PUT to send the new representation to
the resource&#39;s URI.

Recall from [OSLC Defined Resources: Unknown properties and
content](#Unknownpropertiesand_content) above that, when doing an
update, OSLC clients must preserve any unknown property-values and other
content in OSLC Defined Resources.

Because the update process involves first getting a resource, modifying
it and then later putting it back to the server there is the possibility
of a conflict, e.g. some other client may have have updated the resource
since the GET. To mitigate this problem, OSLC Services SHOULD use
the HTTP If-Match header:

If the HTTP If-Match header is missing OSLC Services SHOULD
    return HTTP Bad Request (400) status code to indicate that the
    header is required.
If the HTTP If-Match header is present OSLC Services MUST
    behave as described in the HTTP specification, returning an HTTP
    Precondition Failed (412) error to indicate that the header does
    not match.
If the HTTP If-Match header is present and it matches, but there
    is some other problem or conflict with the update then OSLC Services
    MAY return an HTTP Conflict (409) to indicate that problem.

Note that section Error Responses below, we specify
that when an error occurs and useful information can be provided to
clients OSLC Services SHOULD return error information in the body of
the response.

Resource Paging
---------------

OSLC Services MAY support a technique called Resource Paging to
enable clients to retrieve resources one page at a time.

When a client requests a resource, the client can expect that the entire
resource will be returned in the response, with all property values.
This can be problematic because, in some cases, resources may be so
large that a client might not want to retrieve the entire resource in
one HTTP response.

One solution for response size-sensitive Clients is to check size before
loading. Clients that do not wish to load large resources can use the
HTTP HEAD method to determine the size of a resource and, according to
the rules of HTTP the server&#39;s SHOULD include an HTTP Content-Length
header that indicates the size of the resource as the &#34;decimal number of
OCTETs.&#34; If the size is too large, a client can choose not to retrieve
the resource.

Another solution is to use Resource Paging; here&#39;s how it works. To get
a paged version of a resource, a client adds the
&#34;keyvalue&#34; pair =oslc.paging=true to the query component of the
resource URI and the server MAY respond by returning a
representation that contains partial information about the resource;
only a subset of the resource&#39;s property values.

When a page is returned and it is NOT the last page in the sequence,
then it SHOULD include an oslc:ResponseInfo (defined below), which
that contains a resource-valued property oslc:nextPage that links to a
resource that represents the next page of property-values. Because
paging is unstable (see below), by the time a client follows an
oslc:nextPage link there may no longe be a next page, in this case the
server MAY respond with an HTTP 404 Page Not Found status code.

A client can also request paging by adding the
&#34;keyvalue&#34; pair =oslc.pageSize to the query string component of the
resource URI. By adding this, a client requests that the server respond
with a specific number of property values. For example,
oslc.pageSize=20 indicates to the server that the client would like 20
values per page. OSLC Services MAY ignore oslc.pageSize.

When Resource Paging is used, the values of a multi-valued property
MAY be split across resource pages. Each property value MUST be
represented in its entirety and not split across multiple partial
resource pages.

Provider response-size limitations

When a client requests a resource that an OSLC Service considers to be
too large to return in one response and the client has not indicated
that it desires paging (via oslc.paging or oslc.pageSize), the OSLC
Service MAY redirect the client to a representation that contains
partial information about the resource, as follows:

The OSLC Service receives an HTTP GET request for a resource that
    exceeds size limits and URL does not include oslc.paging or an
    oslc.pageSize key/value pair.
The OSLC Service returns an HTTP Status 302 redirect a URL that does
    include the key/values for paging, as follows:
    If the client did not indicate paging, the new redirect URL
        MUST include the oslc.paging pair.
    If the client indicated a page size, then the redirect URL
        MUST include the oslc.pageSize pair with a size value that
        is acceptable to the service.
The client MAY choose to follow the redirect and receive a
    representation that contains partial information about the resource.

On receiving a resource representation, OSLC Clients SHOULD check
for the presence of an oslc:nextPage value to determine if the
representation contains partial information about the resource. If the
value is present, then paging is in effect and the representation
contains partial information about the resource.

 Unstable Paging

Because HTTP is a stateless protocol and OSLC Services manage resources
that can change frequently, OSLC clients SHOULD assume that
resources can change as they page through them using the oslc:nextPage
mechanism.

Stable Paging

Some OSLC Services might wish to guarantee stable paging, meaning that
the chain of oslc:nextPage links in a resource represent a snapshot in
time and will not change as the client pages through them. OSLC
specifications that require stable paging SHOULD state this
requirement and specify to which resources it applies.

Note that because stable paging implementations are based on server-side
state, it is possible that such state will expire. Implementations
MAY use the HTTP response code 410 (Expired) to indicate to clients
that the next-page link they requested has expired.

 Response Information

Resource representations returned via Resource Paging MUST include a
resource of type oslc:ResponseInfo, as defined in this section. A
response info resource representation describes information about a
paged HTTP response body in which it appears.

The subject resource URI of the oslc:ResponseInfo resource
representation will be the HTTP request URI, or URI from subsequent
redirects. The response representation may also include properties from
subject resources different from the one identified by the request URI.

Here&#39;s an example, using the OSLC Core RDF/XML representation guidance,
that illustrates how the oslc:ResponseInfo resource representation is
included in addition to the blog entry resource representation.

representation**

 &amp;lt;/rdf:RDF&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/verbatim&amp;gt;

Refer to the OSLC Defined Resource Representation guidance for an
explanation of how the response info resource may be represented in
RDF/XML.

Selective Property Values
-------------------------

OSLC Services MAY support a technique called Selective Properties to
enable clients to retrieve only selected property values.

By adding the keyvalue pair =oslc.properties, specified below, to a
resource URI, a client can request a new resource with a subset of the
original resource&#39;s values. Here&#39;s how the selective properties values
oslc.properties and oslc.prefix work.

oslc.properties

The oslc.properties key=value pair lets you specify the set of
properties to be included in the response. Both immediate and nested
properties may be specified. A nested property is a property that
belongs to the resource referenced by another property. Nested
properties are enclosed in brace brackets, and this nesting may be done
recursively, i.e. a nested property may contain other nested properties.

For example, suppose we have a bug report resource at the following URL:

      http://example.com/bugs/4242

Suppose this bug resource has properties such as dcterms:title,
dcterms:description, and dcterms:creator, and that dcterms:creator
refers to a person resource that has properties such as foaf:givenName
and foaf:familyName. Suppose you want a representation of the bug
report that includes its dcterms:title and the foaf:givenName and
foaf:familyName of the person refered to by its dcterms:creator. The
following URL illustrates the use of the oslc.properties query value
to include those properties:

     http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.properties=dcterms:title,dcterms:creator{foaf:givenName,foaf:familyName}

Syntax

The oslc.properties pair is defined by the oslc_properties term in
the following BNF grammar:

     oslc_properties ::= &#34;oslc.properties=&#34; properties
     properties      ::= property (&#34;,&#34; property)*
     property        ::= identifier | wildcard | nested_prop
     nested_prop     ::= (identifier | wildcard) &#34;{&#34; properties &#34;}&#34;
     wildcard        ::= &#34;*&#34;
     identifier      ::= PrefixedName
     PrefixedName    ::= /* see &#34;SPARQL Query Lanaguage for RDF&#34;, http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/rPrefixedName */

oslc.prefix

In our examples of oslc.properties, property names include a URI
prefix, i.e. dcterms: or foaf:. An OSLC Service SHOULD predefine
URI prefixes for its properties. Here we assume that OSLC has predefined
the Dublin Core ( dcterms:) and Friend of a Friend ( foaf:)
prefixes. However, OSLC resources SHOULD also be open to new
content, which means that new properties may not have predefined URI
prefixes. We therefore need a way to define new URI prefixes in resource
requests. The oslc.prefix value lets you specify URI prefixes used in
property names. For example, suppose the foaf: prefix was not
predefined. The following URL illustrates the use of the oslc.prefix
value to define it:

     http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.prefix=foaf=http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&amp;oslc.properties=foaf:lastName,...

Syntax

The syntax of the oslc.prefix is defined by the oslc_prefix term in
the following BNF grammar:

     oslcprefix ::= &#34;oslc.prefix=&#34; prefixdefs
     prefixdefs ::= prefixdef (&#34;,&#34; prefix_def)*
     prefixdef  ::= prefix &#34;=&#34; uriref_esc
     prefix      ::= PN_PREFIX
     PNPREFIX   ::= /* see &#34;SPARQL Query Lanaguage for RDF&#34;, http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/rPNPREFIX */
     urirefesc ::= /* an angle bracket-delimited URI reference in which  and \ are \-escaped. */

Common Properties
-----------------

OSLC domains specifications are strongly encouraged to use the common
properties approved by the OSLC Core Workgroup (See
OSLC Core Spec Appendix A) rather than
defining new properties.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Service Provider Resources

OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that
describes each service, which domain specifications the service
implements as well as the creation, query and delegated UI capabilities
of each service.

Additionally, a provider may offer a Service Provider Catalog that lists
related Service Providers.

Conceptual Model
----------------

The conceptual model of Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider
resources is simple. They are both resources with property values. The
values allowed and required in each type of resource are defined below.

The diagram below illustrates the Service Provider Catalog and Service
Provider concepts and relationships. As you can see there are two
Resources defined: Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider. There
are also a set of Local In-Line Resources that are used inside the
Resources to define namespaces, OAuth configurations, contributors as
well as services and their capabilities.

Figure \#2: Service Provider concepts and relationships

/&amp;gt;

Next, we will formally define the Service Provider Catalog and Service
Provider resources.

Resource: Service Provider Catalog

An OSLC implementation that offers one or more Service Provider
resources (see below), MAY also provide Service Provider Catalog to
enable OSLC clients to find Service Providers offered. These catalogs
may contain other nested catalogs as well as service providers.

The next sections cover the Creation Factory and Query Capability in
more detail.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creation Factories

An OSLC Service can provide one or more creation factory to enable the
creation of new resources. A creation factory provides a Creation URI
used to create new resources via HTTP POST and may also provide Resource
Shapes that describe the types of resources that may be created. To
create a new OSLC Resource, an OSLC client POSTs a representation of
that resource to a Creation Factory&#39;s Creation URI.

An HTTP POST of content to a Creation URI SHOULD result in the
    creation of a new resource or an explanation of why creation did not
    occur via the appropriate HTTP status code.
The response to a successful HTTP POST of content to a Creation URI
    SHOULD include a HTTP Location header that specifies the URI of
    the newly created resource.

Creating an OSLC Defined Resource
---------------------------------

To create an OSLC Defined Resource, an OSLC Client first forms an
representation of that resource including the desired and required
property values. A client can learn what properties are allowed in a new
OSLC Defined Resource via the OSLC specification that defines or, in
some cases via a Resource Shape resource. Next the client uses HTTP POST
to post that representation to a Creation URI.

The response to a successful HTTP POST of a representation to a
    Creation Resource URI MAY include a representation of the newly
    created resource.
The resource returned MAY contain changes to properties made by
    the server or new properties added by the server.

Query Capabilities

An OSLC Service may provide one or more Query Capabilities to enable
query of resources. A Query Capability provides a base URI for forming
Query Resource URIs and MAY provide Resource Shapes that describe
the property values that may be expected in the resources that are
queryable via the query capability. Thus, Query Capabilities provide a
way to discover the resources managed by an OSLC Service.

In a Query Capability, the base URI, as defined by the oslc:queryBase
property, is itself a resource managed by the service and it acts as the
starting subject resource for the queries based on it. Since the list
may contain hundreds of thousands of members, queries are used to filter
the list for members that satisfy certain conditions, e.g. the bugs that
have high priority and were created this week.

Conceptual Model
----------------

To perform a query an OSLC client first creates a URI by starting with a
Query Capability&#39;s base URI as a base and adding a URI Query String to
express the query criteria. The OSLC client then uses HTTP GET to
request a Query Resource representation of the query results. The Query
Resource representation will contain property values about the query and
a collection of resources that match the query criteria.

HTTP GET Queries

To perform an HTTP GET query, an OSLC client starts with the base URI as
defined by the oslc:queryBase property of a Query Capability, and
appends to it query parameters in a syntax supported by the service. The
resulting URI is the query URI. The OSLC client sends an HTTP GET
request to the query URI, optionally specifying the preferred content
media type for the query response in the HTTP Accept header. OSLC
Services MUST support query responses in RDF/XML format (media type
application/rdf&#43;xml) and MAY support other formats. OSLC Services
SHOULD support the Query Syntax defined in this specification, but
MAY support other syntaxes.

Query Syntax
------------

A query URI can be formed by adding a query string to the end of the
Query Capability&#39;s base URI (or by sending the query string in the
request body when using HTTP POST). The syntax used to express the query
criteria in that string is specified by each OSLC domain specification.

The OSLC Core Spec Query Specification document
defines a standard set of OSLC query parameters that other OSLC domain
specifications MAY use to query resources.

 Query Specification errors

If there is an error in the specification of the query, whether the
query is specified by key=value pairs in the HTTP GET URL or key=value
pairs in the body of an HTTP POST, then the provider MUST respond
with an error. The error response should be an HTTP 400 Bad Request
error and an explanation of the error in the OSLC Error Response format
(see Error Responses below).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Delegated User Interface Dialogs

OSLC specifications target specific integration scenarios. In some
cases, allowing one product to delegate to a user interface defined in
another product is a more effective way to support a use case than an
HTTP interface that can only be accessed programmatically. There are two
cases where this is especially true:

Resource creation: when a user of a web application needs to
    create a new resource in an OSLC Service Provider. In this case the
    web application asks the service provider to provide a UI for
    resource creation and the provider notifies the application when the
    creation has been completed or canceled by the user.
Resource selection: when a user of a web application and needs
    to pick a resource managed by a OSLC Service Provider. In this case
    the web application asks the service provider to provide a UI for
    resource selection and the provider notifies the application when a
    resource or resources has been selected or if the selection
    was canceled.

To support these two cases, below we define OSLC Delegated User
Interface (UI) Dialogs. Delegated UI Dialogs are a technique where one
provider can embed a creation or selection UI into another using a
combination of an HTML &amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt; and JavaScript code. The diagram
below illustrates how delegated UI dialogs work in a scenario where
Provider A wants to allow a user to select or create a resource managed
by Provider B.

Figure \#3: Delegated UI Dialog interactions

&lt;img alt=&#34;Delegated UI Dialogs&#34;
src=&#34;/img/specifications/core-2.0/oslc-delegated.png&#34;/

Next, the details of the Delegated UI Dialog protocol.

Terminology

The following terms are used in discussions of Delegated UI Dialogs:

UI Consumer - a web application that is embedding a Delegated UI
    Dialog from an OSLC Service Provider. This consumer could be a web
    page, with the Delegated UI Dialog loaded into an iframe or a native
    application, e.g. an IDE like Eclipse, that is embedding a web
    browser component.

!-- --

UI Provider - an OSLC Service provider that offers one or more
    Delegated UI Dialogs. These dialogs will be specified in the
    provider&#39;s Service Provider resource.

The next sections explain how Delegated UI Dialogs work.

Post Message and Window Name protocols
--------------------------------------

To support the widest range of web browsers, we define two different
protocols for communicating the information about the user&#39;s action from
the UI Provider and back to the UI Consumer. These are the Post Message
and Window Name protocols described below.

In both the Post Message and Window Name protocols, the way that a UI
Consumer includes a Delegated UI Dialog in an HTML page is to create an
iframe and specify the src as the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog to
be included. The UI Consumer indicates the protocol to be used by
appending one of the two fragment identifiers below to the URI:

oslc-core-postMessage-1.0 - Indicates that the Post Message
    protocol is to be used
#oslc-core-windowName-1.0 - Indicates that the Window Name
    protocol is to be used

The JavaScript code example below shows now a UI Provider can determine
which protocol is in use:

         if (window.location.hash == &#39;#oslc-core-windowName-1.0&#39;) {
             // Window Name protocol in use
         } else if (window.location.hash == &#39;#oslc-core-postMessage-1.0&#39;) {
             // Post Message protocol in use
         }

iframe Creation Considerations

Regardless of the protocol in effect, it is recommended that UI
Consumers follow the below iframe creation guidelines to provide a more
seamless user experience:

Embed the iframe within a div element, with height and width set
    based on the relative length values specified in the Service
    Resource that declares the Delegated UI Dialog.
Set the iframe border size to &#39;0&#39;
Set the iframe scrolling to &#39;auto&#39;

Next, the details for each of the two protocols.

 Post Message Protocol

The Post Message protocol relies on the HTML5 function
window.postMessage() (reference: HTML5), available in the latest or
pending releases of most browsers. UI Consumers must anticipate other,
unrelated uses of postMessage(), and should ignore messages not
conforming to this protocol.

Typically, the embedded page will be loaded in a window inside another
window, such as a iframe inside some surrounding webpage. In such cases,
postMessage() must be called on that parent window. But in a native
application, an outer page is not needed and the embedded page may be
shown directly in the browser&#39;s &#34;root&#34; window. When the embedded page
has no parent window, it must call postMessage() on its own window.

Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in Post
Message protocol.

The UI Consumer&#39;s responsibilities

1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to
the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. Append
the fragment identifier \oslc-core-postMessage-1.0 to the URL to
indicate that Post Message is the desired protocol. 1 Add a &#39;message&#39;
listener to the outer window to receive messages from the Delegated UI
Dialog. 1 Listen for window &#39;message&#39; events, ignoring events from other
sources or not prefixed with &#34;oslc-response:&#34; 1 When message from
Delegated UI Dialog indicates user completed action, free resources and
handle action.

The UI Provider&#39;s responsibilities

1 Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user
interface for resource creation or selection. 1 Allow the user to
perform resource creation or selection. 1 Once the user has created,
selected or canceled, send notification using postMessage() to the
page&#39;s parent window, passed in event.data string, that is prefixed
with &#34;oslc-response:&#34; See below for the two possible response formats,
one for resource selection and one for creation. 1 If the page is not
parented, then the message is posted to the page&#39;s own window. The page
must ignore this message to itself.

The below JavaScript code example shows how a UI Provider page would
send a response using postMessage() and taking into account the fact
that some pages are not parented.

        function respondWithPostMessage(/string/ response) {
           (window.parent | window).postMessage(&#34;oslc-response:&#34; &#43; response, &#34;*&#34;);
        }

Now, the Window Name protocol.

 Window Name Protocol

The Window Name protocol uses the HTML DOM window.name property to
communicate the response (reference: Window Object) from the UI Provider
to the UI Consumer. This special property of window maintains its value
even as the window navigates to a different origin, but the ifame&#39;s
window.name can only be read when the accessing window shares the same
origin. For this to happen, when the embedded page is finished it must
set the window.name and also change the window.location to a page
with the same origin as the outer frame. This not only allows the UI
Consumer to access the result, but also fires an event telling the UI
Consumer when to do so. This return location is passed to the embedded
page using the window.name property.

Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in
Window Name protocol.

The UI Consumer&#39;s responsibilities

1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to
the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. Append
the fragment identifier \oslc-core-windowName-1.0 to the URL to
indicate that Window Name is the desired protocol. 1 On the iframe, set
the frame&#39;s window.name to indicate the Return URL. 1 On the iframe,
Listen for &#39;onload&#39; events 1 When an &#39;onload&#39; event occures an the
frame&#39;s location is equal to the Return URL then read the response from
the window.name.

The following Javascript code illustrates the protocol. The code for the
destroyFrame(), handleMessage() and displayFrame() methods are not
provided in this example, but should be obvious to a JavaScript
developer. The UI Consumer must provide these methods.

         var pickerURL = ... // URL of Provider&#39;s Delegated UI Dialog
         var returnURL = ... // Consumer&#39;s Return URL

         var frame = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;);

        function windowNameProtocol() {

           // Step #1: create iframe with fragment to indicate protocol
           // Step #2: set the iframe&#39;s window.name to indicate the Return URL
           if (ie  0) {
              frame = document.createElement(&#39;iframe name=\&#39;&#39; &#43; returnURL &#43; &#39;\&#39;&#39;);
           } else {
              frame = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;);
              frame.name = returnURL;
           }
           frame.src = pickerURL &#43; &#39;#oslc-core-windowName-1.0&#39;;
           frame.width = 450;
           frame.height = 300;

           displayFrame(frame);

           // Step #3: listen for onload events on the iframe
           var ie = window.navigator.userAgent.indexOf(&#34;MSIE&#34;);
           if (ie  0) {
              frame.attachEvent(&#34;onLoad&#34;, onFrameLoaded);
           } else {
              frame.onload = onFrameLoaded;
           }
        }

        function onFrameLoaded() {
           try { // May throw an exception if the frame&#39;s location is still a different origin

              // Step #4: when frame&#39;s location is equal to the Return URL
              // then read response and return.
              if (frame.contentWindow.location == returnURL) {
                 var message = frame.contentWindow.name;
                 destroyFrame(frame);
                 handleMessage(message);
              }

           } catch (e) {
              // ignore: access exception when trying to access window name
           }
        }

The UI Provider&#39;s responsibilities

As soon as the embedded page has loaded, perform the following:

1 *Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user
interface for resource creation or selection.* 1 *Read the Return URL
from the window.name variable* 1 &amp;lt;span style=&#34;font-family:
Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small&#34;&amp;gt;Allow user to
perform resource creation or selection.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; 1 Once user has
created, selected or canceled, communicate the user&#39;s response by
setting the window.name variable to the response. See below for the two
possible response formats, one for resource selection and one for
creation. 1 Indicate that user has responded by setting the
window.location to the Return URL specified by the UI Consumer.

The JavaScript example below shows a UI Provider notifying its UI
Consumer after a user has responded.

     function respondWithWindowName(/string/ response) {
        // Step 2: read the return URL
        var returnURL = window.name;

        // Step #4: send the response via the window.name variable
        window.name = response;

        // Step #5: indicate that user has responded
        window.location = returnURL;
     }

Resource Selection
------------------

Resource Selection can be used when a UI Consumer wants to allow a user
to pick a resource that is managed by an OSLC Service. Using either the
Post Message or Window Name protocols defined above, the UI Consumer
uses an iframe to embed a selection dialog that is provided by the
service, then awaits notification that the user has selected a resource.

To enable Resource Selection, an OSLC Service MUST provide in its
Service Resource a value for the oslc:selectionDialog property. The
property value will include a oslc:dialogURI property that indicates
the URI of the selection dialog.

Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the
UI Consumer, the response SHOULD be formatted as follows:

Name: results
URI: http://open-services.net/ns/core#results

| Prefixed Name  | Occurs      | Read-only | Value-type | Represen-tation | Range | Description                                  |
|:---------------|:------------|:----------|:-----------|:----------------|:------|:---------------------------------------------|
| rdf:resource | zero-or-one | True      | Resource   | Reference       | n/a   | URI of the resource selected or created      |
| oslc:label   | zero-or-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a   | Short label describing the resource selected |

An empty array indicates that the resource selector has been canceled

An example Resource Selection response:

     {
         &#34;oslc:results&#34; : [{
                 &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 123: Server crash&#34;,
                 &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug123&#34;
             }, {
                 &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 456: Client hangs on startup&#34;,
                 &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug456&#34;
             }
         ]
     }

Resource Creation
-----------------

Resource Creation can be used when a UI Consumer wants to allow a user
to create a new resource that is managed by an OSLC Service. Using
either the Post Message or Window Name protocols defined above, the UI
Consumer uses an iframe to embed a creation dialog that is provided by
the service, then awaits notification that the user has created a
resource.

To enable Resource Creation, an OSLC Service MUST provide in its
Service Resource a value for the oslc:creationDialog property. The
property value will include a oslc:dialogURI property that indicates
the URI of the creation dialog.

Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the
UI Consumer, the response SHOULD be formatted as defined by
oslc:results

Example:

     {
         &#34;oslc:results&#34; : [ {
                 &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 123: Server crash&#34;,
                 &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug123&#34;
             }, {
                 &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 456: Client hangs on startup&#34;,
                 &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug456&#34;
             }
         ]
     }

Prefilling Creation Dialogs

Service providers MAY support receiving a POST request whose content
body is a resource representation to the Creation Dialog URI to retrieve
a URI that represents the embedded page to be used. Service providers
MUST respond with a response status of 201 (Created) with the
response header Location whose value is the URI to request the newly
created form. After some elapsed time, service providers MAY respond
with a 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone) or 3xx (Redirect) to an HTTP GET
request for these URIs.

Dialog Resizing
---------------

Delegated UI dialogs receive their initial size (dimensions) based on
the oslc:hintWidth and oslc:hintHeight properties described in
oslc:Dialog resource description. There are cases where UI Provider
recognizes that the initial size of a Delegated UI dialog is not
sufficient and needs a way to ask the UI Consumer to resize the dialog.
In this section we specify a mechanism that enables dialog resizing, but
only when Post Message Protocol is used.

Consumers MAY honor a dialog&#39;s ability to dynamically resize. Those
that do (a) MUST use Post Message Protocol, (b) MUST use the
oslc:resize value instead of any static width or height, and and (c)
MUST register a handler to receive dialog resize messages sent by
the dialog Provider and adjust the size of the dialog accordingly.

Since a dialog is allowed to resize itself any number of times, the
Consumer MUST keep a handler registered and react appropriately each
time it received a dialog resize message from that dialog.

UI Providers SHOULD NOT request sizes larger than 95% of the current
viewport, to avoid
covering the entire viewport with the dialog.

Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in
dialog resizing.

 The UI Consumer&#39;s responsibilities

1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to
the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. 1 Add a
&#39;message&#39; listener to the outer window to receive messages from the
Delegated UI Dialog. 1 Listen for window &#39;message&#39; events, ignoring
events from other sources or not prefixed with &#34;oslc-resize:&#34;. Multiple
resize &#39;message&#39; events may be sent while the dialog is visible. 1 When
message from Delegated UI Dialog indicates user completed action, free
resources and handle action.

The UI Provider&#39;s responsibilities

1 Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user
interface for resource creation or selection. 1 Allow the user to
perform resource creation or selection. 1 Once the Provider needs to
resize the dialog, send notification using postMessage() to the page&#39;s
parent window, passed in event.data string, that is prefixed with
&#34;oslc-resize:&#34;. Multiple resize messages may be sent. See below for the
response format. 1 If the page is not parented, then the message is
posted to the page&#39;s own window. The page must ignore this message to
itself.

The below JavaScript code example shows how a UI Provider page would
send a response using postMessage() and taking into account the fact
that some pages are not parented.

        function respondWithPostMessage(/string/ resize_response) {
           (window.parent | window).postMessage(&#34;oslc-resize:&#34; &#43; resize_response, &#34;*&#34;);
        }

Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the
UI Consumer, the response SHOULD be formatted as follows:

| Prefixed Name     | Occurs      | Read-only | Value-type | Represen-tation | Range | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|:------------------|:------------|:----------|:-----------|:----------------|:------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| oslc:hintHeight | exactly-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a   | New dialog height size. Height size MUST be expressed in relative length units as defined in the W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1) Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size) |
| oslc:hintWidth  | exactly-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a   | New dialog width size. Width size MUST be expressed in relative length units as defined in the W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1) Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size)   |

An example Dialog Resize response with new height of &#39;600px&#39; and a width
of &#39;400px&#39;:

     {
         &#34;oslc:hintHeight&#34; : &#34;600px&#34;,
         &#34;oslc:hintWidth&#34; : &#34;400px&#34;
     }

That brings us to the end of the Delegated UI section. Next up, another
UI related topic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

User Interface Previews

OSLC providers MAY support a technique known as User Interface (UI)
Preview, that can be used to show a user in-context information when
displaying a link to a resource, and to show more information when the
user&#39;s mouse lingers over the link.

OSLC providers which offer UI Preview MUST do so in accordance with
the OSLC Core UI Preview Specification.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication

OSLC Services use standard web protocols for authentication. OSLC
Services can use HTTP Basic Authentication, OAuth or both.

HTTP Basic Authentication
-------------------------

OSLC Services MAY protect resources with HTTP Basic Authentication.
OSLC Services that use HTTP Basic Authentication SHOULD do so only
via SSL.

OAuth Authentication
--------------------

OSLC Services MAY protect resources with OAuth Authentication.

Form Based Authentication
-------------------------

OSLC Services MAY use other authentication mechanisms, including
those common described as Form Based Authentication. OSLC Services that
choose to use other authentication mechanisms are responsible for
specifying how those mechanisms work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Error Responses

OSLC Services the standard mechanisms of HTTP to report status and error
codes to clients. When an error occurs and useful information can be
provided to clients OSLC Services SHOULD return error information in
the body of the response.

OSLC Services SHOULD use the Error resource defined below as the
basis for forming error responses. OSLC Services SHOULD return an
Error resource using the same representation requested by the client via
the HTTP Accept header.

Conceptual Model
----------------

The following OSLC Defined Resource can be used as the basis for forming
an error response.

 Resource: Error

Name: Error
URI: http://open-services.net/ns/core#Error

| Prefixed Name        | Occurs      | Read-only | Value-type | Represen-tation | Range                | Description                                                |
|:---------------------|:------------|:----------|:-----------|:----------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| oslc:statusCode    | exactly-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a                  | The HTTP status code reported with the error.              |
| oslc:message       | exactly-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a                  | An informative message describing the error that occurred. |
| oslc:extendedError | zero-or-one | True      | Either     | Either          | oslc:ExtendedError | Extended error information                                 |

| oslc:moreInfo   | zero-or-one | True      | Resource   | Reference       | Any   | A resource giving more information on the error SHOULD be of an HTML content-type.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| oslc:rel        | zero-or-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a   | If present and set to &#39;alternate&#39; then indicates that work-around is provided, behavior for other values is undefined.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| oslc:hintWidth  | zero-or-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a   | Values MUST be expressed in relative length units as defined in the W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1) Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size). |
| oslc:hintHeight | zero-or-one | True      | String     | n/a             | n/a   | Values MUST be expressed in relative length units as defined in the W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1) Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size). |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specification Versioning

One of the goals of the OSLC initiative is to mitigate or eliminate the
need for lock-step version upgrades, where clients or services target
one version of a specification and break when new versions are
introduced -- requiring all services to be upgraded simultaneously.

In this section we specify a version header that will enable old
&#34;Version 1&#34; OSLC clients to continue to work and share the same resource
URIs as used by clients that specifically target the Core. And we
establish rules that will enable clients to continue to work as new
versions of specifications are introduced.

Supporting pre-Core clients
---------------------------

We anticipate that the OSLC Core and domain specifications will each be
versioned independently and each version will be assigned a version
number, but we would like to avoid exposing version numbers in OSLC
implementations. There is one use case that requires version information
to be exposed. We must ensure that old OSLC &#34;Version 1&#34; clients continue
to work.

To enable OSLC Service specifications to evolve without breaking
existing clients, we introduce an HTTP Header, OSLC-Core-Version set
to the Core specification version number &#34;2.0&#34;. We expect clients that
target the Core to send this HTTP header.

If the OSLC-Core-Version header is present and set to a version
    that the service can support, then the service MUST return a
    representation that is complies with the specified version.
If the OSLC-Core-Version header is present and indicates a
    specification version that the service cannot support, the service
    SHOULD respond with what it determines is the most compatible
    version that it can return.
If the OSLC-Core-Version header is not present then the OSLC
    Service SHOULD respond by returning a resource that conforms to
    the earliest or most compatible (as determined by
    the implementation) specification version&#39;s representation. Services
    that never offered an OSLC Version 1 interface can ignore
    this restriction.
When returning an OSLC Defined Resource, OSLC Services MUST
    return the OSLC-Core-Version header set to the Core specification
    with which the representation complies.

Rules for new versions of OSLC specifications
---------------------------------------------

When specifying a new version of an OSLC specification the rule is this:

**A new version of an OSLC specification is not allowed to introduce
changes that will break old clients.**

Here are some guidelines for OSLC workgroups defining new specifications
or upgrades to existing ones:

If you believe that you need a property but cannot agree on the
    value-type, then this is a strong indication that you should not
    attempt to standardize on the property. Once you decide on a
    value-type you are stuck with it forever. Wait until you have the
    scenarios or implementation experience needed to agree on type.
When introducing a new capability in a new version of a
    specification, e.g. a creation factory, query capability or
    delegated UI dialog; one that works differently than those specified
    in the Core spec or older versions of your own specification, you
    should create a new resource type to represent the service. This
    will enable old clients to continue to work against old services and
    new clients to work with your new capabilities.
When defining resources, do not remove, change the meaning or the
    value-type of any properties that you defined in earlier versions of
    the specification. You can add new properties but not change those
    that already exist.
It is possible to relax restrictions on clients, because relaxing
    restrictions should not break clients. But it is not possible to
    relax restrictions on services, because clients expect to find the
    required fields and if they are missing, clients will break.
Before defining a new property within your OSLC domain&#39;s namespace
    consult the list of common properties in
    OSLC Core Spec Appendix A to see if
    using a common property would be more appropriate.

Migrating to the Core Specification
-----------------------------------

Most of the first OSLC specifications were developed before this Core
specification existed and do not implement versioning as described above
and so must use some other mechanism to migrate to the OSLC Core v1.0
specification.

OSLC implementations that wish to continue to support old pre-Core OSLC
or OSLC v1.0 specifications can do so by keeping the old implementation
in place and adding the new OSLC Core v1 implementation with different
service provider, query capability and creation factory URIs.

OSLC Defined Resource Representations

This section specifies what resource representations are required for
OSLC resources, some requirements for providing representations and some
rational for the requirement that OSLC Services provide RDF/XML
representations.

OSLC resource representations come in many forms and are subject to
standard HTTP mechanisms for content negotiation.

OSLC domain specifications (1) SHOULD require the representations
needed for the specific scenarios that they are addressing and (2)
SHOULD recognize that different representations are appropriate for
different purposes. For example, browser oriented scenarios might be
best addressed by JSON or Atom format representations. For these
reasons, OSLC Services MAY provide and accept standard or emerging
standard formats such as XML, JSON, HTML, Turtle and the Atom
Syndication Format.

OSLC domain specifications are also expected to follow common practices
and conventions that are in concert with existing industry standards and
offer consistency across domains. All of the OSLC specifications are
built upon the standard RDF data model, allowing OSLC to align with the
W3C&#39;s Linked Data initiative. In addition, all OSLC specifications have
adopted the convention to illustrate RDF/XML representations and will
typically require RDF/XML representations to enable consistency across
OSLC implementations. For those reasons, OSLC Services SHOULD
provide and accept RDF/XML representations for each OSLC resource.

Though the OSLC Core workgroup does provide guidance on how to form
RDF/XML representations using a subset of RDF/XML (reference: [Appendix
B - Representation Guidance and
Examples](OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations)), OSLC clients **SHOULD
NOT* assume any specific form of RDF/XML. It is *RECOMMENDED** that
OSLC Services also provide an HTML representation for each resource.

Use standard content-types

Note that existing standard content-types are used, e.g.
application/rdf&#43;xml and application/json, in this document and no
new content-types are introduced (except for the one introduced in the
UI Preview specification). Those writing OSLC
specifications are strongly encouraged to follow this pattern -- use
standard and existing content-types and avoid inventing new
content-types for existing formats.

In past OSLC specifications we defined a specific RDF/XML format for
each resource defined and gave each its own content-type. This implied
to consumers that each resource had a different format when in reality
they were all standard RDF/XML. Using different content-types makes it
more difficult to write generic tools, crawlers and other services that
work across all data.

 Order of property values insignificant

This specification defines how OSLC property values are to be
represented in a variety of formats. Except in the case of a sorted
Query Response, the ordering of property values is insignificant. OSLC
clients and service providers MUST not place any significance on the
ordering of property values in representations.

Use Absolute URIs

OSLC representations MUST use absolute URIs in all cases except XML
representations, where the xml:base attribute may be used to allow
relative URIs to be resolved to absolute form (reference: XML Base).

Before a resource representation that uses xml:base is posted to an OSLC
Service for creation, it may include relative URIs that cannot be
resolved until the OSLC Service has received, created and assigned a URI
to the new resource.

---&#43; Overview

(this section is informative)

The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative is creating a family of web services specifications for products, services and other tools that support all phases of the software and product lifecycle. The purpose of these specifications is to enable integration between products that support Application Life-cycle Management (ALM) and Product Life-cycle Management (PLM). Each part of the lifecycle or domain has its own group and specification, for example there are Change Management, Quality Management, Estimation &amp; Measurement and more. Each of the domain specifications are built upon this core specification.

This OSLC Core Specification sets out the common features that every OSLC Service can be expected to support using terminology from the World Wide Web Consortium (!W3C). New terminology that we introduce can be found in the glossary section below. This specification is mostly about OSLC Services, it specifies what OSLC Services MUST, SHOULD and MAY do. It also contains some required behaviors for OSLC clients and rules for OSLC domain specifications that extend this specification.

OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that describes the Services offered. Each Service can provide Creation Factories for resource creation, Query Capabilities for resource query and Delegated UI Dialogs to enable clients to create and select resources via a web UI. Query Capabilities and Creation Factories may offer Resource Shapes that describe the properties of resources managed by the service. This is illustrated in the diagram below. See the section below on Service Provider Resources for further discussion of these concepts.

*Figure #1: OSLC Core Specification concepts and relationships*



This specification establishes terminology and rules for defining resources in terms of the property names and value-types that are allowed and required. OSLC domain specifications are expected to use these rules and terminologies to describe their resources. See the OSLC Defined Resources section for more on this topic.

This specification also sets out rules for creating resource representations in RDF/XML, JSON, Atom and Turtle formats. OSLC domain specifications are expected to refer to these rules when specifying how their resources are to be represented. See the OSLC Defined Resource Representations section for the representation rules and examples of each format.

#AboutTheVersionNumber *About the version number.* We use the version number &#34;2.0&#34; even though there has never been an OSLC Core Version 1.0 specification. We do this because this OSLC Core specification was written after a series of version 1.0 domain specifications were finalized by OSLC workgroups. The version 2.0 domain specifications will all be based on this Core specification and _to avoid confusion_ this specification will also be known as Version 2.0.

*About RDF*. The resource and property-based data model used in OSLC resources is based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and OSLC requires RDF representations, but OSLC uses a small number of RDF concepts and does not require implementers to provide an RDF triple-store or a SPARQL query-engine.

---&#43;&#43; Design considerations

The core philosophies of OSLC are to build on the powerful and scalable architecture of the World Wide Web and to do the simplest possible things that will work.

*Build on the WWW*. OSLC builds on the architecture of the WWW and follows the REST architectural pattern. This means that OSLC Services provide a uniform HTTP interface, OSLC URIs are stable and opaque and, in simple terms, OSLC works like the web.

*Keep things simple*. Doing the simplest things that will possibly work means a couple of different things in regard to OSLC. It means starting with simple and existing concepts. For example, we model everything as resources with property values and do not stray from that model. Keeping things simple also means building on established and well-known specifications, but also carefully limiting the number of other specifications that we reference. This simplicity is intended to enable loose coupling and to make life easier for everybody: OSLC domain work groups, OSLC Service implementers and OSLC client developers.

*Accommodate different schemas*. Because of the breadth of the OSLC domains, spanning lifecycle and platforms, OSLC has to work for systems with very different data schemas or no schemas at all. Flexibility is needed, but some OSLC Services must be able to offer information about resource properties so that clients can learn which are allowed and required for resource creation, query and reporting.

*Accommodate different representations*. Different client platforms might require or at least prefer different representations. For example, in the browser a JSON or Atom format representation might work best. OSLC Services will all support RDF/XML and may support other formats including JSON, Atom and Turtle.

*Align with the !W3C Linked Data initiative*. Instead of defining a new data model, OSLC&amp;rsquo;s resource and property-value approach is based on industry standard Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model. This model allows OSLC to keep things simple, build on the WWW and accommodate different schemas.

---&#43;&#43; Glossary of terms

This is a guide to some of the terminology used in this document. The following definitions are standard !W3C concepts. OSLC uses these concepts without modification &amp;ndash; their definitions are summarized here for the convenience of the reader. See http://www.w3c.org.

   * *Resource*: A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI. Resources may be available in multiple representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, resolutions) or vary in other ways. (reference: HTTP)

   * *Representation*: An HTTP payload entity, included in an HTTP response, that is subject to content negotiation. There may exist multiple representations. associated with a particular HTTP response status. (reference: HTTP)

   * *URI*: Uniform Resource Identifiers are simply formatted strings which identify--via name, location, or any other characteristic -- a resource (reference: URI Syntax)

Here are the OSLC specific terms used in this specification.

(these definitions are normative)

   * *OSLC Domain*: an OSLC Domain is one ALM or PLM topic area such as Change Management, Requirements management or Automation. Each OSLC Domain will have its own OSLC specification that complies with this Core specification.

   * *OSLC Service*: a set of capabilities that enable a web client to create, retrieve, update and delete resources managed by an ALM or PLM product or online service offering and associated with one OSLC Domain.

   * *OSLC Service Provider*: a product or online service offering that provides an implementation of one or more OSLC Services, which may themselves implement different OSLC Domain specifications.

   * *OSLC Resource*: a resource that is managed by an OSLC Service, may have properties and may link to other resources including those provided by other OSLC Services.

   * *OSLC Defined Resource*: a resource that is defined by an OSLC specification, see OSLC Defined Resources below.

   * *OSLC Defined Properties*: resource properties that are defined by an OSLC specification, defined by an OSLC Resource Shape or both.

   * *OSLC Resource Shape*: defines the set of OSLC Properties expected in a resource for specific operations (i.e. creation, update or query) for each their value types, allowed values, cardinality and optionality. Examples of such operations include OSLC Creation Resource and Query Resource. Other examples might include applications that display data in tables.

   * *OSLC Creation Factory*. A creation factory provides a URI used to create new resources via HTTP POST and may also provide Resource Shapes that describe the types of resources that may be created.

   * *OSLC Query* *Capability*: A query capability provides a base URI for forming query resource URIs and, optionally, Resource Shapes that describe the property values that may be used in query expressions and returned in query results.

   * *OSLC Response Info Resource*: An OSLC Defined Resource that provides information about a paged resource representation, e.g. the next page in a multi-page query result representation.

Here are some industry terms that we use in this specification:

   * *Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)*: ALM is the marriage of business management to software engineering made possible by tools that facilitate and integrate requirements management, architecture, coding, testing, tracking, and release management ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_lifecycle_management]]).
   * *Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)*: In industry, product lifecycle management (PLM) is the process of managing the entire lifecycle of a product from its conception, through design and manufacture, to service and disposal (from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle_management]]).

And finally, we use the following two terms to describe portions of the OSLC Core specification:

   * *Normative*. Normative sections of this document set forth requirements that must be met to establish conformance with the OSLC Core specification; or providing recommendations or optional courses of action. This is done using use words from [[http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt][RFC-2119]] (e.g. MUST, SHOULD, MAY, etc.). For recommended or optional features, conformance is not dependent on the fact of implementation, but, if implemented, that implementation is as prescribed in this specification. Contrast with informative.

   * *Informative*. Informative text provides background or explanation. Contrast with Normative. It should be clear which sentences and paragraphs are informative from the context and the absence of RFC-2119 keywords. Sections that are purely informative will be marked as informative. Informative text that might be mistaken for normative will also be marked.

---&#43; OSLC Defined Resources

An OSLC Resource is a resource managed by an OSLC Service. An OSLC Resource is typically something like a Change Request, a Requirement or some other ALM or PLM artifact or record, but an OSLC Resource could also be a video or a presentation file. The resource&amp;rsquo;s storage medium is unconstrained by OSLC, e.g. it could be stored in a relational database, a flat-file on disk, a source code control system, or in any other way.

An OSLC Service can manage any type of resource; OSLC specifications only constrain an OSLC Service&amp;rsquo;s behavior with respect to resource types it manages that are defined by OSLC specifications (OSLC Defined Resources). OSLC Defined Resources may be specified in any OSLC specification, including this document. Resources are defined by the properties that are allowed and required in the resource.

---&#43;&#43; OSLC Defined Resources

OSLC uses a simple model of resources with property values intended to be consistent with the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model (reference: RDF Concepts). OSLC also builds upon the Extensible Markup Language (XML) namespace mechanism (reference: XML Namespaces).

When specifying a resource or a property, OSLC Specifications define its type as a URI which can be decomposed into a namespace URI and a name. We abbreviate type URIs as Prefixed Names (reference: Prefixed Names), which are represented in XML as QNames. The namespace used for resources defined in this specification is defined as follows:

   * Namespace URI: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#=
   * Default Prefix: =oslc=

When defining an OSLC Resource type, OSLC Specifications *MUST* provide the following information:

   * *Name* (String): name of the resource which *MUST* be valid as the Local Name part of a QName (reference: XML Namespaces).
   * *URI* (URI): The URI of the resource definition. Per the rules of Prefixed Names, this URI is formed by appending the Name to the end of the Namespace URI in the specification that defines the resource. For example, the resource named Service (defined below) gets the Type URI of =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Service=.

Once a resource type is defined, its allowed and required properties can be defined.

Regardless of any property definitions, providers and clients MAY impose implementation-specific limits on resources they accept. For example, they are not required to accept/create/store resources whose RDF triples contain objects with arbitrarily large literal values.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Defining OSLC Properties

OSLC Specifications *MAY* provide a list of properties allowed and/or required for a particular domain and operation on an OSLC Defined Resource; if no operation is specified, then the list applies to all operations governed by that specification. Specifications that provide a list of properties and constraints on them *SHOULD* provide the following information for each property that they define.

   * *Name*: name of the property which *MUST* be valid as the Local Name part of a QName (reference: XML Namespaces).
   * *URI*: The URI that identifies the property. The URI is formed by appending the Name to the end of the Namespace URI associated with the property. For example, the resource named =oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog= (defined below in the Service Providers Section) defines a property named =domain= with the URI of =http://open-services.net/ns/core#domain=
   * *Description*: Description of the property.
   * *Occurs*: value *MUST* be one of:
      * [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Exactly-one= ]]
      * [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-one= ]]
      * [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Zero-or-many= ]]
      * [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#One-or-many= ]]
   * *Value-types*: A property *MAY* allow multiple value-types and a value *MUST* satisfy one or more of them. Each value-type *MUST* be a URI that corresponds to one of the following:
      * Literal value-types:
         * *Boolean*: a boolean type as specified by XSD Boolean ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *DateTime*: a Date and Time type as specified by XSD dateTime ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *Decimal*: a decimal number type as specified by XSD Decimal ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#decimal=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *Double*: a double floating-point number type as specified by XSD Double ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#double=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *Float*: a floating-point number type as specified by XSD Float ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *Integer:* an integer number type as specified by XSD Integer ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *String*: a string type as specified by XSD String ( =http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string=, reference: XSD Datatypes).
         * *XMLLiteral*: a Literal XML value ( [[http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral][ =http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral= ]]).
      * Resource value-types:
         * *Resource*: value is a resource at a specified URI (i.e. a URI Reference) ( [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Resource][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Resource= ]] ).
         * *Local Resource*: value is an resource available only inside the resource being defined (i.e. a Blank Node) ( [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#LocalResource][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#LocalResource= ]] ).
         * *AnyResource*: value is either a *Resource* or *Local Resource* as defined above ( [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#AnyResource][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#AnyResource= ]] ).
   * *Representation*: for properties with a resource value-type, OSLC specifications should also specify how the resource will be represented. The options are [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Reference= ]] , [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Inline= ]] or [[http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either][ =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Either= ]].
   * *Range*: for properties with a resource value-type, OSLC specifications should follow the best practices in [[OslcCoreSpecAppendixLinks][Appendix C Guidance on Links and Relationships]], which usually results in no restrictions on the range of possible resource types allowed, and an informative recommendation in the property description suggesting which resource types implementations should expect to find. This can be specified as a list of one or more resource types specified by URI reference; when no restrictions are required, use the string any. Clients SHOULD allow any resource type as the target of a link. Providers are strongly *RECOMMENDED* to behave reasonably for all resource types listed in a property&amp;rsquo;s description, and to degrade gracefully for others, as defined in Appendix C.
   * *Read-only*: Boolean indication of whether or not clients are permitted to replace the property&amp;rsquo;s value after the resource has been created. Allowable values are: true, false, unspecified.
      * *True* indicates that providers *SHOULD NOT* permit clients to change the property&amp;rsquo;s value after the resource has been created.
      * *False* indicates that providers *MAY* permit clients to change the property&amp;rsquo;s value after the resource has been created.
      * *Unspecified* indicates that the domain specification leaves the choice up to provider implementations.

In the rest of this document we will define OSLC resources as described above. The below section titled OSLC Defined Resource Representations defines how OSLC resources are to be represented in RDF/XML, JSON and other formats.

OSLC Services that wish to provide the information above in a machine-readable format *MAY* use OSLC Resource Shapes, see [[OSLC Core Spec Appendix A][Appendix A: Common Properties and Resources]] for more information.

NOTE: we do not mention Internationalization of strings here because we expect standard HTTP content-negotiation and representation (e.g. =xml:lang=) mechanisms to be used for such.

---&#43;&#43; Unknown properties and content

For OSLC Defined Resources, clients *SHOULD* assume that an OSLC Service will discard unknown property values. An OSLC Service *MAY* discard property values that are not part of the resource definition or Resource Shape known by the server. If a client needs verification that the requested update was accepted it *SHOULD* note the HTTP response header ETag value returned with the HTTP PUT, Immediately HTTP GET the resource back and compare the HTTP response header ETag value and contents with its expectations. The Service *SHOULD* *NOT* return an error code for unrecognized content. A Service *MUST* return an error code if recognized content is invalid.

The rule is different for clients. When doing an update, OSLC clients *MUST* preserve any unknown property-values and other content in OSLC Defined Resources.

See following section on Resource Update.

---&#43;&#43; Resource Operations

OSLC Services use HTTP for create, retrieve, update and delete operations on resources. OSLC Services *MUST* comply with the HTTP specification (reference: HTTP).

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource Creation 

(this section is informative)

To create an OSLC Defined Resource, or any type of resource managed by an OSLC Service, an OSLC client HTTP POSTs a representation of that resource to a Creation URI. See the section on [[#Creation_Factories][Creation Factories]] for more information.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource Removal

(this section is informative)

To delete an OSLC Defined Resource, or any type of resource managed by a service, a client performs an HTTP DELETE on the resource&#39;s URI.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource Update

To update an OSLC Resource in an OSLC Service, a client fetches a representation of that resource via HTTP GET. The client updates the representation and then uses HTTP PUT to send the new representation to the resource&#39;s URI.

Recall from [[#Unknown_properties_and_content][OSLC Defined Resources: Unknown properties and content]] above that, when doing an update, OSLC clients must preserve any unknown property-values and other content in OSLC Defined Resources.

Because the update process involves first getting a resource, modifying it and then later putting it back to the server there is the possibility of a conflict, e.g. some other client may have have updated the resource since the GET. To mitigate this problem, OSLC Services *SHOULD* use the HTTP =If-Match= header:

   * If the HTTP =If-Match= header is missing OSLC Services *SHOULD* return HTTP Bad Request (400) status code to indicate that the header is required.
   * If the HTTP =If-Match= header is present OSLC Services *MUST* behave as described in the HTTP specification, returning an HTTP Precondition Failed (412) error to indicate that the header does not match.
   * If the HTTP =If-Match= header is present and it matches, but there is some other problem or conflict with the update then OSLC Services *MAY* return an HTTP Conflict (409) to indicate that problem.

Note that section [[#Error_Responses][Error Responses]] below, we specify that when an error occurs and useful information can be provided to clients OSLC Services *SHOULD* return error information in the body of the response.

---&#43;&#43; Resource Paging

OSLC Services *MAY* support a technique called Resource Paging to enable clients to retrieve resources one page at a time.

When a client requests a resource, the client can expect that the entire resource will be returned in the response, with all property values. This can be problematic because, in some cases, resources may be so large that a client might not want to retrieve the entire resource in one HTTP response.

One solution for response size-sensitive Clients is to check size before loading. Clients that do not wish to load large resources can use the HTTP HEAD method to determine the size of a resource and, according to the rules of HTTP the server&#39;s *SHOULD* include an HTTP Content-Length header that indicates the size of the resource as the &#34;decimal number of OCTETs.&#34; If the size is too large, a client can choose not to retrieve the resource.

Another solution is to use Resource Paging; here&#39;s how it works. To get a paged version of a resource, a client adds the &#34;key=value&#34; pair =oslc.paging=true= to the query component of the resource URI and the server *MAY* respond by returning a representation that contains partial information about the resource; only a subset of the resource&#39;s property values.

When a page is returned and it is *NOT* the last page in the sequence, then it *SHOULD* include an =oslc:ResponseInfo= (defined below), which that contains a resource-valued property =oslc:nextPage= that links to a resource that represents the next page of property-values. Because paging is unstable (see below), by the time a client follows an =oslc:nextPage= link there may no longe be a next page, in this case the server *MAY* respond with an HTTP 404 Page Not Found status code.

A client can also request paging by adding the &#34;key=value&#34; pair =oslc.pageSize= to the query string component of the resource URI. By adding this, a client requests that the server respond with a specific number of property values. For example, =oslc.pageSize=20= indicates to the server that the client would like 20 values per page. OSLC Services *MAY* ignore =oslc.pageSize=.

When Resource Paging is used, the values of a multi-valued property *MAY* be split across resource pages. Each property value *MUST* be represented in its entirety and not split across multiple partial resource pages.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Provider response-size limitations

When a client requests a resource that an OSLC Service considers to be too large to return in one response and the client has not indicated that it desires paging (via oslc.paging or oslc.pageSize), the OSLC Service *MAY* redirect the client to a representation that contains partial information about the resource, as follows:
   * The OSLC Service receives an HTTP GET request for a resource that exceeds size limits and URL does not include =oslc.paging= or an =oslc.pageSize= key/value pair.
   * The OSLC Service returns an HTTP Status 302 redirect a URL that does include the key/values for paging, as follows:
      * If the client did not indicate paging, the new redirect URL *MUST* include the =oslc.paging= pair.
      * If the client indicated a page size, then the redirect URL *MUST* include the =oslc.pageSize= pair with a size value that is acceptable to the service.
   * The client *MAY* choose to follow the redirect and receive a representation that contains partial information about the resource.

On receiving a resource representation, OSLC Clients *SHOULD* check for the presence of an =oslc:nextPage= value to determine if the representation contains partial information about the resource. If the value is present, then paging is in effect and the representation contains partial information about the resource.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Unstable Paging

Because HTTP is a stateless protocol and OSLC Services manage resources that can change frequently, OSLC clients *SHOULD* assume that resources can change as they page through them using the =oslc:nextPage= mechanism.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Stable Paging

Some OSLC Services might wish to guarantee stable paging, meaning that the chain of =oslc:nextPage= links in a resource represent a snapshot in time and will not change as the client pages through them. OSLC specifications that require stable paging *SHOULD* state this requirement and specify to which resources it applies.

Note that because stable paging implementations are based on server-side state, it is possible that such state will expire. Implementations *MAY* use the HTTP response code 410 (Expired) to indicate to clients that the next-page link they requested has expired.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Response Information

Resource representations returned via Resource Paging *MUST* include a resource of type =oslc:ResponseInfo=, as defined in this section. A response info resource representation describes information about a paged HTTP response body in which it appears.

   * *Name*: =ResponseInfo=
   * *URI*: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#ResponseInfo=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =dcterms:title= | zero-or-one | True | XML Literal | n/a | n/a | Title of the response |
| =dcterms:description= | zero-or-one | True | XML Literal | n/a | n/a | Description of response |
| =oslc:nextPage= | zero-or-one | True | Resource | Reference | =any= | Link to next page of response |
| =oslc:totalCount= | zero-or-one | True | Integer | n/a | n/a | This optional property indicates the total number of results across all pages, its value should be non-negative. In the context of a query resource, this value *SHOULD* be the total number of results, i.e. the number of resources that match the query. In the context of other resources, the value *SHOULD* be the total number of property values (i.e. RDF triples) of the resource. Unless Stable Paging is in effect, the total count *MAY* vary as a client retrieves subsequent pages. |

The subject resource URI of the =oslc:ResponseInfo= resource representation will be the HTTP request URI, or URI from subsequent redirects. The response representation may also include properties from subject resources different from the one identified by the request URI.

Here&#39;s an example, using the OSLC Core RDF/XML representation guidance, that illustrates how the =oslc:ResponseInfo= resource representation is included in addition to the blog entry resource representation.

*Example: Resource Paging, partial response with response info resource representation*

Example URI: =http://example.com/blogs/entry/1?oslc.paging=true&amp;pageno=2=

 


   
      
   

   
      
   




Refer to the OSLC Defined Resource Representation guidance for an explanation of how the response info resource may be represented in RDF/XML.

---&#43;&#43; Selective Property Values

OSLC Services *MAY* support a technique called Selective Properties to enable clients to retrieve only selected property values.

By adding the key=value pair =oslc.properties=, specified below, to a resource URI, a client can request a new resource with a subset of the original resource&#39;s values. Here&#39;s how the selective properties values =oslc.properties= and =oslc.prefix= work.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; oslc.properties

The =oslc.properties= key=value pair lets you specify the set of properties to be included in the response. Both immediate and nested properties may be specified. A nested property is a property that belongs to the resource referenced by another property. Nested properties are enclosed in brace brackets, and this nesting may be done recursively, i.e. a nested property may contain other nested properties.

For example, suppose we have a bug report resource at the following URL:
 http://example.com/bugs/4242

Suppose this bug resource has properties such as =dcterms:title=, =dcterms:description=, and =dcterms:creator=, and that =dcterms:creator= refers to a person resource that has properties such as =foaf:givenName= and =foaf:familyName=. Suppose you want a representation of the bug report that includes its =dcterms:title= and the =foaf:givenName= and =foaf:familyName= of the person refered to by its =dcterms:creator=. The following URL illustrates the use of the =oslc.properties= query value to include those properties:

http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.properties=dcterms:title,dcterms:creator{foaf:givenName,foaf:familyName}


*Syntax*

The =oslc.properties= pair is defined by the =oslc_properties= term in the following BNF grammar:
oslc_properties ::= &#34;oslc.properties=&#34; properties
properties      ::= property (&#34;,&#34; property)*
property        ::= identifier | wildcard | nested_prop
nested_prop     ::= (identifier | wildcard) &#34;{&#34; properties &#34;}&#34;
wildcard        ::= &#34;*&#34;
identifier      ::= PrefixedName
PrefixedName    ::= /* see &#34;SPARQL Query Lanaguage for RDF&#34;, http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rPrefixedName */

---&#43;&#43;&#43; oslc.prefix

In our examples of =oslc.properties=, property names include a URI prefix, i.e. =dcterms:= or =foaf:=. An OSLC Service *SHOULD* predefine URI prefixes for its properties. Here we assume that OSLC has predefined the Dublin Core ( =dcterms:=) and Friend of a Friend ( =foaf:=) prefixes. However, OSLC resources *SHOULD* also be open to new content, which means that new properties may not have predefined URI prefixes. We therefore need a way to define new URI prefixes in resource requests. The =oslc.prefix= value lets you specify URI prefixes used in property names. For example, suppose the =foaf:= prefix was not predefined. The following URL illustrates the use of the =oslc.prefix= value to define it:

http://example.com/bugs/4242?oslc.prefix=foaf=&amp;oslc.properties=foaf:lastName,...

*Syntax*

The syntax of the =oslc.prefix= is defined by the =oslc_prefix= term in the following BNF grammar:
oslc_prefix ::= &#34;oslc.prefix=&#34; prefix_defs
prefix_defs ::= prefix_def (&#34;,&#34; prefix_def)*
prefix_def  ::= prefix &#34;=&#34; uri_ref_esc
prefix      ::= PN_PREFIX
PN_PREFIX   ::= /* see &#34;SPARQL Query Lanaguage for RDF&#34;, http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/#rPN_PREFIX */
uri_ref_esc ::= /* an angle bracket-delimited URI reference in which &gt; and \ are \-escaped. */

---&#43;&#43; Common Properties

OSLC domains specifications are strongly encouraged to use the common properties approved by the OSLC Core Workgroup (See [[OSLC Core Spec Appendix A]]) rather than defining new properties.

---
 

---&#43; Service Provider Resources

OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that describes each service, which domain specifications the service implements as well as the creation, query and delegated UI capabilities of each service.

Additionally, a provider may offer a Service Provider Catalog that lists related Service Providers.

---&#43;&#43; Conceptual Model 

The conceptual model of Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider resources is simple. They are both resources with property values. The values allowed and required in each type of resource are defined below.

The diagram below illustrates the Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider concepts and relationships. As you can see there are two Resources defined: Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider. There are also a set of Local In-Line Resources that are used inside the Resources to define namespaces, OAuth configurations, contributors as well as services and their capabilities.

*Figure #2: Service Provider concepts and relationships*



Next, we will formally define the Service Provider Catalog and Service Provider resources.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource: Service Provider Catalog

An OSLC implementation that offers one or more Service Provider resources (see below), MAY also provide Service Provider Catalog to enable OSLC clients to find Service Providers offered. These catalogs may contain other nested catalogs as well as service providers.

   * *Name*: =ServiceProviderCatalog=
   * *URI*: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#ServiceProviderCatalog=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =dcterms:title= | zero-or-one | True | XMLLiteral | n/a | n/a | Title of the service provider catalog |
| =dcterms:description= | zero-or-one | True | XMLLiteral | n/a | n/a | Description of the service provider catalog |
| =dcterms:publisher= | zero-or-one | True | Local Resource | Inline | [[#Resource_Publisher][ =oslc:Publisher= ]] | Describes the software product that provides the implementation. |
| =oslc:domain= | zero-or-many | True | Resource | Reference | n/a | Namespace URI of the specification that is implemented by this service. In most cases this namespace URI will be for an OSLC domain, but other URIs MAY be used. |
| =oslc:serviceProvider= | zero-or-many | True | Resource | Either | [[#Resource_Service_Provider][ =oslc:ServiceProvider= ]] | A service offered by the service provider. |
| =oslc:serviceProviderCatalog= | zero-or-many | True | Resource | Either | [[#Resource_Service_Provider_Catalog][ =oslc:ServiceProviderCatalog= ]] | Additional service provider catalog. |
| =oslc:oauthConfiguration= | zero-or-many | True | Local Resource | Inline | [[#Resource_OAuth_Configuration][ =oslc:OAuthConfiguration= ]] | Defines the three OAuth URIs required for a client to act as an OAuth consumer. |

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource: Service Provider

A Service Provider describes a set of services offered by an OSLC implementation.

   * *Name*: =ServiceProvider=
   * *URI*: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#ServiceProvider=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =dcterms:title= | zero-or-one | True | XMLLiteral | n/a | n/a | Title of the service provider |

The next sections cover the Creation Factory and Query Capability in more detail.

---
 

---&#43; Creation Factories

An OSLC Service can provide one or more creation factory to enable the creation of new resources. A creation factory provides a Creation URI used to create new resources via HTTP POST and may also provide Resource Shapes that describe the types of resources that may be created. To create a new OSLC Resource, an OSLC client POSTs a representation of that resource to a Creation Factory&#39;s Creation URI.
   * An HTTP POST of content to a Creation URI *SHOULD* result in the creation of a new resource or an explanation of why creation did not occur via the appropriate HTTP status code.
   * The response to a successful HTTP POST of content to a Creation URI *SHOULD* include a HTTP Location header that specifies the URI of the newly created resource.

---&#43;&#43; Creating an OSLC Defined Resource

To create an OSLC Defined Resource, an OSLC Client first forms an representation of that resource including the desired and required property values. A client can learn what properties are allowed in a new OSLC Defined Resource via the OSLC specification that defines or, in some cases via a Resource Shape resource. Next the client uses HTTP POST to post that representation to a Creation URI.
   * The response to a successful HTTP POST of a representation to a Creation Resource URI *MAY* include a representation of the newly created resource.
   * The resource returned *MAY* contain changes to properties made by the server or new properties added by the server.



---&#43; Query Capabilities

An OSLC Service may provide one or more Query Capabilities to enable query of resources. A Query Capability provides a base URI for forming Query Resource URIs and *MAY* provide Resource Shapes that describe the property values that may be expected in the resources that are queryable via the query capability. Thus, Query Capabilities provide a way to discover the resources managed by an OSLC Service.

In a Query Capability, the base URI, as defined by the =oslc:queryBase= property, is itself a resource managed by the service and it acts as the starting subject resource for the queries based on it. Since the list may contain hundreds of thousands of members, queries are used to filter the list for members that satisfy certain conditions, e.g. the bugs that have high priority and were created this week.

---&#43;&#43; Conceptual Model 

To perform a query an OSLC client first creates a URI by starting with a Query Capability&#39;s base URI as a base and adding a URI Query String to express the query criteria. The OSLC client then uses HTTP GET to request a Query Resource representation of the query results. The Query Resource representation will contain property values about the query and a collection of resources that match the query criteria.

---&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; HTTP GET Queries

To perform an HTTP GET query, an OSLC client starts with the base URI as defined by the =oslc:queryBase= property of a Query Capability, and appends to it query parameters in a syntax supported by the service. The resulting URI is the query URI. The OSLC client sends an HTTP GET request to the query URI, optionally specifying the preferred content media type for the query response in the HTTP Accept header. OSLC Services *MUST* support query responses in RDF/XML format (media type =application/rdf&#43;xml=) and *MAY* support other formats. OSLC Services *SHOULD* support the Query Syntax defined in this specification, but *MAY* support other syntaxes.

---&#43;&#43; Query Syntax

A query URI can be formed by adding a query string to the end of the Query Capability&#39;s base URI (or by sending the query string in the request body when using HTTP POST). The syntax used to express the query criteria in that string is specified by each OSLC domain specification.

The [[OSLCCoreSpecQuery][OSLC Core Spec Query Specification]] document defines a standard set of OSLC query parameters that other OSLC domain specifications *MAY* use to query resources.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Query Specification errors

If there is an error in the specification of the query, whether the query is specified by key=value pairs in the HTTP GET URL or key=value pairs in the body of an HTTP POST, then the provider *MUST* respond with an error. The error response should be an HTTP 400 Bad Request error and an explanation of the error in the OSLC Error Response format (see Error Responses below).

---
 

---&#43; Delegated User Interface Dialogs

OSLC specifications target specific integration scenarios. In some cases, allowing one product to delegate to a user interface defined in another product is a more effective way to support a use case than an HTTP interface that can only be accessed programmatically. There are two cases where this is especially true:

   * *Resource creation*: when a user of a web application needs to create a new resource in an OSLC Service Provider. In this case the web application asks the service provider to provide a UI for resource creation and the provider notifies the application when the creation has been completed or canceled by the user.
   * *Resource selection*: when a user of a web application and needs to pick a resource managed by a OSLC Service Provider. In this case the web application asks the service provider to provide a UI for resource selection and the provider notifies the application when a resource or resources has been selected or if the selection was canceled.

To support these two cases, below we define OSLC Delegated User Interface (UI) Dialogs. Delegated UI Dialogs are a technique where one provider can embed a creation or selection UI into another using a combination of an HTML &amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt; and !JavaScript code. The diagram below illustrates how delegated UI dialogs work in a scenario where Provider A wants to allow a user to select or create a resource managed by Provider B.

*Figure #3: Delegated UI Dialog interactions*



Next, the details of the Delegated UI Dialog protocol.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Terminology

The following terms are used in discussions of Delegated UI Dialogs:

   * *UI Consumer* - a web application that is embedding a Delegated UI Dialog from an OSLC Service Provider. This consumer could be a web page, with the Delegated UI Dialog loaded into an iframe or a native application, e.g. an IDE like Eclipse, that is embedding a web browser component.

   * *UI Provider* - an OSLC Service provider that offers one or more Delegated UI Dialogs. These dialogs will be specified in the provider&#39;s Service Provider resource.

The next sections explain how Delegated UI Dialogs work.

---&#43;&#43; Post Message and Window Name protocols

To support the widest range of web browsers, we define two different protocols for communicating the information about the user&#39;s action from the UI Provider and back to the UI Consumer. These are the Post Message and Window Name protocols described below.

In both the Post Message and Window Name protocols, the way that a UI Consumer includes a Delegated UI Dialog in an HTML page is to create an =iframe= and specify the =src= as the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog to be included. The UI Consumer indicates the protocol to be used by appending one of the two fragment identifiers below to the URI:

   * =#oslc-core-postMessage-1.0= - Indicates that the Post Message protocol is to be used
   * =#oslc-core-windowName-1.0= - Indicates that the Window Name protocol is to be used

The !JavaScript code example below shows now a UI Provider can determine which protocol is in use:


    if (window.location.hash == &#39;#oslc-core-windowName-1.0&#39;) {
        // Window Name protocol in use
    } else if (window.location.hash == &#39;#oslc-core-postMessage-1.0&#39;) {
        // Post Message protocol in use
    }


---&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; iframe Creation Considerations

Regardless of the protocol in effect, it is recommended that UI Consumers follow the below iframe creation guidelines to provide a more seamless user experience:
   * Embed the =iframe= within a =div= element, with height and width set based on the relative length values specified in the Service Resource that declares the Delegated UI Dialog.
   * Set the =iframe= border size to &#39;0&#39;
   * Set the =iframe= scrolling to &#39;auto&#39;

Next, the details for each of the two protocols.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Post Message Protocol

The Post Message protocol relies on the HTML5 function =window.postMessage()= (reference: HTML5), available in the latest or pending releases of most browsers. UI Consumers must anticipate other, unrelated uses of postMessage(), and should ignore messages not conforming to this protocol.

Typically, the embedded page will be loaded in a window inside another window, such as a iframe inside some surrounding webpage. In such cases, =postMessage()= must be called on that parent window. But in a native application, an outer page is not needed and the embedded page may be shown directly in the browser&#39;s &#34;root&#34; window. When the embedded page has no parent window, it must call =postMessage()= on its own window.

Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in Post Message protocol.
---&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; The UI Consumer&#39;s responsibilities
   1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. Append the fragment identifier #oslc-core-postMessage-1.0 to the URL to indicate that Post Message is the desired protocol.
   1 Add a &#39;message&#39; listener to the outer window to receive messages from the Delegated UI Dialog.
   1 Listen for window &#39;message&#39; events, ignoring events from other sources or not prefixed with &#34;oslc-response:&#34;
   1 When message from Delegated UI Dialog indicates user completed action, free resources and handle action.

---&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; The UI Provider&#39;s responsibilities
   1 Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user interface for resource creation or selection.
   1 Allow the user to perform resource creation or selection.
   1 Once the user has created, selected or canceled, send notification using =postMessage()= to the page&#39;s parent window, passed in =event.data= string, that is prefixed with &#34;oslc-response:&#34; See below for the two possible response formats, one for resource selection and one for creation.
   1 If the page is not parented, then the message is posted to the page&#39;s own window. The page must ignore this message to itself.

The below !JavaScript code example shows how a UI Provider page would send a response using =postMessage()= and taking into account the fact that some pages are not parented.
   function respondWithPostMessage(/*string*/ response) {
      (window.parent | window).postMessage(&#34;oslc-response:&#34; &#43; response, &#34;*&#34;);
   }


Now, the Window Name protocol.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Window Name Protocol

The Window Name protocol uses the HTML DOM =window.name= property to communicate the response (reference: Window Object) from the UI Provider to the UI Consumer. This special property of window maintains its value even as the window navigates to a different origin, but the ifame&#39;s =window.name= can only be read when the accessing window shares the same origin. For this to happen, when the embedded page is finished it must set the =window.name= and also change the =window.location= to a page with the same origin as the outer frame. This not only allows the UI Consumer to access the result, but also fires an event telling the UI Consumer when to do so. This return location is passed to the embedded page using the =window.name= property.

Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in Window Name protocol.

---&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; The UI Consumer&#39;s responsibilities

   1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser. Append the fragment identifier #oslc-core-windowName-1.0 to the URL to indicate that Window Name is the desired protocol.
   1 On the iframe, set the frame&#39;s =window.name= to indicate the Return URL.
   1 On the iframe, Listen for &#39;onload&#39; events
   1 When an &#39;onload&#39; event occures an the frame&#39;s location is equal to the Return URL then read the response from the window.name.

The following Javascript code illustrates the protocol. The code for the =destroyFrame()=, =handleMessage()= and =displayFrame()= methods are not provided in this example, but should be obvious to a !JavaScript developer. The UI Consumer must provide these methods.


    var pickerURL = ... // URL of Provider&#39;s Delegated UI Dialog
    var returnURL = ... // Consumer&#39;s Return URL

    var frame = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;);

   function windowNameProtocol() {

      // Step #1: create iframe with fragment to indicate protocol
      // Step #2: set the iframe&#39;s window.name to indicate the Return URL
      if (ie &gt; 0) {
         frame = document.createElement(&#39;&#39;);
      } else {
         frame = document.createElement(&#39;iframe&#39;);
         frame.name = returnURL;
      }
      frame.src = pickerURL &#43; &#39;#oslc-core-windowName-1.0&#39;;
      frame.width = 450;
      frame.height = 300;

      displayFrame(frame);

      // Step #3: listen for onload events on the iframe
      var ie = window.navigator.userAgent.indexOf(&#34;MSIE&#34;);
      if (ie &gt; 0) {
         frame.attachEvent(&#34;onLoad&#34;, onFrameLoaded);
      } else {
         frame.onload = onFrameLoaded;
      }
   }

   function onFrameLoaded() {
      try { // May throw an exception if the frame&#39;s location is still a different origin

         // Step #4: when frame&#39;s location is equal to the Return URL
         // then read response and return.
         if (frame.contentWindow.location == returnURL) {
            var message = frame.contentWindow.name;
            destroyFrame(frame);
            handleMessage(message);
         }

      } catch (e) {
         // ignore: access exception when trying to access window name
      }
   }


---&#43;&#43;&#43;&#43; The UI Provider&#39;s responsibilities

As soon as the embedded page has loaded, perform the following:

   1 _Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user interface for resource creation or selection._
   1 _Read the Return URL from the window.name variable_
   1 Allow user to perform resource creation or selection.
   1 Once user has created, selected or canceled, communicate the user&#39;s response by setting the window.name variable to the response. See below for the two possible response formats, one for resource selection and one for creation.
   1 Indicate that user has responded by setting the window.location to the Return URL specified by the UI Consumer.

The !JavaScript example below shows a UI Provider notifying its UI Consumer after a user has responded.

function respondWithWindowName(/*string*/ response) {
   // Step #2: read the return URL
   var returnURL = window.name;

   // Step #4: send the response via the window.name variable
   window.name = response;

   // Step #5: indicate that user has responded
   window.location = returnURL;
}

---&#43;&#43; Resource Selection

Resource Selection can be used when a UI Consumer wants to allow a user to pick a resource that is managed by an OSLC Service. Using either the Post Message or Window Name protocols defined above, the UI Consumer uses an iframe to embed a selection dialog that is provided by the service, then awaits notification that the user has selected a resource.

To enable Resource Selection, an OSLC Service *MUST* provide in its Service Resource a value for the =oslc:selectionDialog= property. The property value will include a =oslc:dialogURI= property that indicates the URI of the selection dialog.

Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the UI Consumer, the response *SHOULD* be formatted as follows:

   * *Name:* =results=
   * *URI:* =http://open-services.net/ns/core#results=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =rdf:resource=  | zero-or-one | True | Resource | Reference | n/a | URI of the resource selected or created |
| =oslc:label=  | zero-or-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | Short label describing the resource selected |

An empty array indicates that the resource selector has been canceled

An example Resource Selection response:
{
    &#34;oslc:results&#34; : [{
            &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 123: Server crash&#34;,
            &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug123&#34;
        }, {
            &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 456: Client hangs on startup&#34;,
            &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug456&#34;
        }
    ]
}


---&#43;&#43; Resource Creation 

Resource Creation can be used when a UI Consumer wants to allow a user to create a new resource that is managed by an OSLC Service. Using either the Post Message or Window Name protocols defined above, the UI Consumer uses an iframe to embed a creation dialog that is provided by the service, then awaits notification that the user has created a resource.

To enable Resource Creation, an OSLC Service *MUST* provide in its Service Resource a value for the =oslc:creationDialog= property. The property value will include a =oslc:dialogURI= property that indicates the URI of the creation dialog.

Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the UI Consumer, the response *SHOULD* be formatted as defined by =oslc:results=

Example:
{
    &#34;oslc:results&#34; : [ {
            &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 123: Server crash&#34;,
            &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug123&#34;
        }, {
            &#34;oslc:label&#34;: &#34;Bug 456: Client hangs on startup&#34;,
            &#34;rdf:resource&#34;: &#34;http://example.com/bug456&#34;
        }
    ]
} 

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Prefilling Creation Dialogs

Service providers *MAY* support receiving a POST request whose content body is a resource representation to the Creation Dialog URI to retrieve a URI that represents the embedded page to be used. Service providers *MUST* respond with a response status of 201 (Created) with the response header =Location= whose value is the URI to request the newly created form. After some elapsed time, service providers *MAY* respond with a 404 (Not Found), 410 (Gone) or 3xx (Redirect) to an HTTP GET request for these URIs.

---&#43;&#43; Dialog Resizing

Delegated UI dialogs receive their initial size (dimensions) based on the =oslc:hintWidth= and =oslc:hintHeight= properties described in =oslc:Dialog= resource description. There are cases where UI Provider recognizes that the initial size of a Delegated UI dialog is not sufficient and needs a way to ask the UI Consumer to resize the dialog. In this section we specify a mechanism that enables dialog resizing, but only when Post Message Protocol is used.

Consumers *MAY* honor a dialog&#39;s ability to dynamically resize. Those that do (a) *MUST* use Post Message Protocol, (b) *MUST* use the =oslc:resize= value instead of any static width or height, and and (c) *MUST* register a handler to receive dialog resize messages sent by the dialog Provider and adjust the size of the dialog accordingly.

Since a dialog is allowed to resize itself any number of times, the Consumer *MUST* keep a handler registered and react appropriately each time it received a dialog resize message from that dialog.

UI Providers *SHOULD NOT* request sizes larger than 95% of the current [[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#viewport][viewport]], to avoid covering the entire viewport with the dialog.

Here are the responsibilities of the UI Consumer and UI Provider in dialog resizing.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; The UI Consumer&#39;s responsibilities

   1 Include the Delegated UI Dialog via iframe (i.e setting iframe src to the URI of the Delegated UI Dialog) or via an embedded browser.
   1 Add a &#39;message&#39; listener to the outer window to receive messages from the Delegated UI Dialog.
   1 Listen for window &#39;message&#39; events, ignoring events from other sources or not prefixed with &#34;oslc-resize:&#34;. Multiple resize &#39;message&#39; events may be sent while the dialog is visible.
   1 When message from Delegated UI Dialog indicates user completed action, free resources and handle action.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; The UI Provider&#39;s responsibilities

   1 Provide Delegated UI Dialog, an HTML page that provides a user interface for resource creation or selection.
   1 Allow the user to perform resource creation or selection.
   1 Once the Provider needs to resize the dialog, send notification using =postMessage()= to the page&#39;s parent window, passed in =event.data= string, that is prefixed with &#34;oslc-resize:&#34;. Multiple resize messages may be sent. See below for the response format.
   1 If the page is not parented, then the message is posted to the page&#39;s own window. The page must ignore this message to itself.

The below !JavaScript code example shows how a UI Provider page would send a response using =postMessage()= and taking into account the fact that some pages are not parented.

   function respondWithPostMessage(/*string*/ resize_response) {
      (window.parent | window).postMessage(&#34;oslc-resize:&#34; &#43; resize_response, &#34;*&#34;);
   }


Regardless of how the response from the UI Provider is conveyed to the UI Consumer, the response *SHOULD* be formatted as follows:

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =oslc:hintHeight=  | exactly-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | New dialog height size. Height size *MUST* be expressed in __relative length units__ as defined in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/syndata.html#length-units ][W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1)]] Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size)  |
| =oslc:hintWidth=  | exactly-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | New dialog width size. Width size *MUST* be expressed in __relative length units__ as defined in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/syndata.html#length-units ][W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1)]] Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size)  |

An example Dialog Resize response with new height of &#39;600px&#39; and a width of &#39;400px&#39;:
{
    &#34;oslc:hintHeight&#34; : &#34;600px&#34;,
    &#34;oslc:hintWidth&#34; : &#34;400px&#34;
} 

That brings us to the end of the Delegated UI section. Next up, another UI related topic.

---
 

---&#43; User Interface Previews

OSLC providers *MAY* support a technique known as User Interface (UI) Preview, that can be used to show a user in-context information when displaying a link to a resource, and to show more information when the user&#39;s mouse lingers over the link.

OSLC providers which offer UI Preview *MUST* do so in accordance with the [[OslcCoreUiPreview][OSLC Core UI Preview Specification]].

---
 

---&#43; Authentication

OSLC Services use standard web protocols for authentication. OSLC Services can use HTTP Basic Authentication, OAuth or both.

---&#43;&#43; HTTP Basic Authentication

OSLC Services *MAY* protect resources with HTTP Basic Authentication. OSLC Services that use HTTP Basic Authentication *SHOULD* do so only via SSL.

---&#43;&#43; OAuth Authentication

OSLC Services *MAY* protect resources with OAuth Authentication.

---&#43;&#43; Form Based Authentication

OSLC Services *MAY* use other authentication mechanisms, including those common described as Form Based Authentication. OSLC Services that choose to use other authentication mechanisms are responsible for specifying how those mechanisms work.

---
 

---&#43; Error Responses

OSLC Services the standard mechanisms of HTTP to report status and error codes to clients. When an error occurs and useful information can be provided to clients OSLC Services *SHOULD* return error information in the body of the response.

OSLC Services *SHOULD* use the Error resource defined below as the basis for forming error responses. OSLC Services *SHOULD* return an Error resource using the same representation requested by the client via the HTTP Accept header.

---&#43;&#43; Conceptual Model 

The following OSLC Defined Resource can be used as the basis for forming an error response.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource: Error

   * *Name*: =Error=
   * *URI*: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#Error=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =oslc:statusCode= | exactly-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | The HTTP status code reported with the error. |
| =oslc:message= | exactly-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | An informative message describing the error that occurred. |
| =oslc:extendedError= | zero-or-one | True | Either | Either | =oslc:ExtendedError= | Extended error information |

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Resource: Extended Error

   * *Name*: =ExtendedError=
   * *URI*: =http://open-services.net/ns/core#ExtendedError=

| *Prefixed Name* | *Occurs* | *Read-only* | *Value-type* | *Represen-tation* | *Range* | *Description* |
| =oslc:moreInfo= | zero-or-one | True | Resource | Reference | Any | A resource giving more information on the error *SHOULD* be of an HTML content-type. |
| =oslc:rel= | zero-or-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | If present and set to &#39;alternate&#39; then indicates that work-around is provided, behavior for other values is undefined. |
| =oslc:hintWidth= | zero-or-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | Values *MUST* be expressed in __relative length units__ as defined in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/syndata.html#length-units ][W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1)]] Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size). |
| =oslc:hintHeight= | zero-or-one | True | String | n/a | n/a | Values *MUST* be expressed in __relative length units__ as defined in the [[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/syndata.html#length-units ][W3C Cascading Style Sheets Specification (CSS 2.1)]] Em and ex units are interpreted relative to the default system font (at 100% size). |

---&#43; Specification Versioning

One of the goals of the OSLC initiative is to mitigate or eliminate the need for lock-step version upgrades, where clients or services target one version of a specification and break when new versions are introduced -- requiring all services to be upgraded simultaneously.

In this section we specify a version header that will enable old &#34;Version 1&#34; OSLC clients to continue to work and share the same resource URIs as used by clients that specifically target the Core. And we establish rules that will enable clients to continue to work as new versions of specifications are introduced.

---&#43;&#43; Supporting pre-Core clients

We anticipate that the OSLC Core and domain specifications will each be versioned independently and each version will be assigned a version number, but we would like to avoid exposing version numbers in OSLC implementations. There is one use case that requires version information to be exposed. We must ensure that old OSLC &#34;Version 1&#34; clients continue to work.

To enable OSLC Service specifications to evolve without breaking existing clients, we introduce an HTTP Header, =OSLC-Core-Version= set to the Core specification version number =&#34;2.0&#34;=. We expect clients that target the Core to send this HTTP header.
   * If the =OSLC-Core-Version= header is present and set to a version that the service can support, then the service *MUST* return a representation that is complies with the specified version.
   * If the =OSLC-Core-Version= header is present and indicates a specification version that the service cannot support, the service *SHOULD* respond with what it determines is the most compatible version that it can return.
   * If the =OSLC-Core-Version= header is not present then the OSLC Service *SHOULD* respond by returning a resource that conforms to the earliest or most compatible (as determined by the implementation) specification version&#39;s representation. Services that never offered an OSLC Version 1 interface can ignore this restriction.
   * When returning an OSLC Defined Resource, OSLC Services *MUST* return the =OSLC-Core-Version= header set to the Core specification with which the representation complies.

---&#43;&#43; Rules for new versions of OSLC specifications

When specifying a new version of an OSLC specification the rule is this:

*A new version of an OSLC specification is not allowed to introduce changes that will break old clients.*

Here are some guidelines for OSLC workgroups defining new specifications or upgrades to existing ones:
   * If you believe that you need a property but cannot agree on the value-type, then this is a strong indication that you should not attempt to standardize on the property. Once you decide on a value-type you are stuck with it forever. Wait until you have the scenarios or implementation experience needed to agree on type.
   * When introducing a new capability in a new version of a specification, e.g. a creation factory, query capability or delegated UI dialog; one that works differently than those specified in the Core spec or older versions of your own specification, you should create a new resource type to represent the service. This will enable old clients to continue to work against old services and new clients to work with your new capabilities.
   * When defining resources, do not remove, change the meaning or the value-type of any properties that you defined in earlier versions of the specification. You can add new properties but not change those that already exist.
   * It is possible to relax restrictions on clients, because relaxing restrictions should not break clients. But it is not possible to relax restrictions on services, because clients expect to find the required fields and if they are missing, clients will break.
   * Before defining a new property within your OSLC domain&#39;s namespace consult the list of common properties in [[OSLC Core Spec Appendix A]] to see if using a common property would be more appropriate.

---&#43;&#43; Migrating to the Core Specification

Most of the first OSLC specifications were developed before this Core specification existed and do not implement versioning as described above and so must use some other mechanism to migrate to the OSLC Core v1.0 specification.

OSLC implementations that wish to continue to support old pre-Core OSLC or OSLC v1.0 specifications can do so by keeping the old implementation in place and adding the new OSLC Core v1 implementation with different service provider, query capability and creation factory URIs.

---&#43; OSLC Defined Resource Representations

This section specifies what resource representations are required for OSLC resources, some requirements for providing representations and some rational for the requirement that OSLC Services provide RDF/XML representations.

OSLC resource representations come in many forms and are subject to standard HTTP mechanisms for content negotiation.

OSLC domain specifications (1) *SHOULD* require the representations needed for the specific scenarios that they are addressing and (2) *SHOULD* recognize that different representations are appropriate for different purposes. For example, browser oriented scenarios might be best addressed by JSON or Atom format representations. For these reasons, OSLC Services *MAY* provide and accept standard or emerging standard formats such as XML, JSON, HTML, Turtle and the Atom Syndication Format.

OSLC domain specifications are also expected to follow common practices and conventions that are in concert with existing industry standards and offer consistency across domains. All of the OSLC specifications are built upon the standard RDF data model, allowing OSLC to align with the W3C&#39;s Linked Data initiative. In addition, all OSLC specifications have adopted the convention to illustrate RDF/XML representations and will typically require RDF/XML representations to enable consistency across OSLC implementations. For those reasons, OSLC Services *SHOULD* provide and accept RDF/XML representations for each OSLC resource.

Though the OSLC Core workgroup does provide guidance on how to form RDF/XML representations using a subset of RDF/XML (reference: [[OSLCCoreSpecAppendixRepresentations][Appendix B - Representation Guidance and Examples]]), OSLC clients *SHOULD NOT* assume any specific form of RDF/XML. It is *RECOMMENDED* that OSLC Services also provide an HTML representation for each resource.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Use standard content-types

Note that existing standard content-types are used, e.g. =application/rdf&#43;xml= and =application/json=, in this document and no new content-types are introduced (except for the one introduced in the [[OslcCoreUiPreview][UI Preview specification]]). Those writing OSLC specifications are strongly encouraged to follow this pattern -- use standard and existing content-types and avoid inventing new content-types for existing formats.

In past OSLC specifications we defined a specific RDF/XML format for each resource defined and gave each its own content-type. This implied to consumers that each resource had a different format when in reality they were all standard RDF/XML. Using different content-types makes it more difficult to write generic tools, crawlers and other services that work across all data.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Order of property values insignificant

This specification defines how OSLC property values are to be represented in a variety of formats. Except in the case of a sorted Query Response, the ordering of property values is insignificant. OSLC clients and service providers *MUST* not place any significance on the ordering of property values in representations.

---&#43;&#43;&#43; Use Absolute URIs

OSLC representations *MUST* use absolute URIs in all cases except XML representations, where the =xml:base= attribute may be used to allow relative URIs to be resolved to absolute form (reference: XML Base).

Before a resource representation that uses xml:base is posted to an OSLC Service for creation, it may include relative URIs that cannot be resolved until the OSLC Service has received, created and assigned a URI to the new resource.

The purpose of this page is to provide a single index of all the vocabulary documents on the OSLC website. Not all these vocabularies are from OASIS Standards. Some are references to current OSLC v2.0 domain specifications that have not yet been migrated to OASIS. Others are still under development and may change. Consult the corresponding specification to learn about its status. The process by which the domain namespaces are mapped to the RDF Schema and HTML documents is documented in the following documents:

OSLC Core URI Naming Guidance
Best Practice Recipes for Publishing RDF Vocabularies
OSLC Core 3.0 Part 1: Overview specification#Resource Constraints

The namespace for each domain is defined in the domain specification.

OSLC version compatibility guidelines specify that updated OSLC vocabularies should be backward compatible. That is, classes and properties can be added, or deprecated (archaic), but may not be changed or removed. Resource shapes on the other hand can be created to constrain these vocabularies for whatever purpose is needed, including the needs of the OSLC specifications themselves. As a result, new vocabularies published on this site should be compatible with the old vocabularies. Therefore, only the most recent version of the vocabularies are listed here, and linked to by the various OSLC core and domain namespace URIs.

                <div class="content-paragraph"> 
As a newcomer to the OSLC community, you might have been pondering over one question, but too shy to ask it aloud:

 Why should I invest my time and effort into OSLC?

Great that you asked! There are many good reasons for you to embrace OSLC and the specific reasons depend on your role. If you are...

.. a Tool Vendor

As a tool vendor, you need to ensure that your customers can integrate your product with other tools in order to extract the most value from your product. While providing a REST API is a norm nowadays, a developer has to build an integration layer. As every REST API is different, it means extra time reading the documentation, extra time developing plumbing code to perform model transformation, and most importantly, all this needs to be done on a case basis, leading to point-to-point integrations.

OSLC allows you to provide:

a uniform self-descriptive REST API;
a linked data model based on standard domains, common in ALM/PLM (RM, QM, CCM, etc.), that you can tailor to your product;
exchange data in plain JSON with the clients that are not linked-data ready;
provide rich UIs from your tool for use in 3rd-party tools for seamless linked data workflow;
and many other features that your customers would appreciate.

A number of other products used in ALM/PLM already implement OSLC and your OSLC-enabled tool can integrate with many of them without extra development effort.

 ..  a Tool Buyer

As a tool buyer, you have a unique set of requirements towards your toolchain and for many reasons (technical, organisational, financial) a single-vendor solution might not be viable for you. Therefore, one of the most important criteria for procurement of the new software tools is their TCO including the integration costs. Most of the tools come with semi-open proprietary APIs that often lack documentation. Those APIs will incur considerable development costs, often involving highly specialised consultants with a deep knowledge of the tool in question.

Tools that come with an OSLC-based API will you to integrate them into your toolchain with less (or none, in many cases) development effort, while performing a deeper integration, at the workflow level.

OSLC reduces the complexity and risk of increasingly complex software infrastructures, and improves the value of software across a broader set of internal and external stakeholders. OSLC-based API is an experience truly free from a vendor lock-in.

.. a Tool User

As a tool user, you have to switch between a plethora of tools on a daily basis. You often don&#39;t see how their integration is done, but you feel that it&#39;s done poorly: updates showing up in other tools many hours later, integrations getting broken every other tool update, etc.

Well-implemented OSLC integrations mostly remain backwards-compatible even across major releases. Standardised OSLC APIs often allow vendors to provide a fully supported integration with many other OSLC-compliant tools out of the box. Finally, an OSLC integration can be performed not only at the level of two tool data models, but at the level of your workflow involving those tools. This is possible through the use of delegated UIs, which allow you to interact with another OSLC-compatible tool without leaving your current open tool!

The Human factors (HF) working group resources will define a set of use cases and scenarios that will feed the concepts necessary for exchange in order facilitate the use of human factors in systems engineering. The term &#39;systems engineering&#39; is used to describe the interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on the design and management of a system over the whole lifecycle.

HF is the application of human factors methods to develop systems with an effective, comfortable and user friendly design. HF seeks to avoid HF issues which are typically problems in which humans do not work with the system in a way as expected thus negatively impacting the overall system performance. When properly applied at the design stage, HF reduces situations where the human does not act or behave as expected. 

The discipline of HF involves many methods such as data collection, task analysis, cognitive task analysis, human error identification, situation awareness analysis and interface analysis techniques. The implementation of these methods and the results they produce must be orchestrated around the existing design process of a project. HF is multidisciplinary and takes place across the entire lifecycle. The implementation of methods can only be done with meaningful input from the system design and for maximum effect; the results must be fed back into that design.
