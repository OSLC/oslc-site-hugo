      <description>OSLC4JS is a set of related open source projects that support the creation and integration of Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC)-based client and server applications that leverage JavaScript and Node.js capabilities. OSLC4JS projects cover the complete end-to-end capabilities required to build, extend, and integrate web apps that exploit OSLC integration capabilities and linked data resources.
Why should I contribute?
Because youâ€™ll see a lot of benefits. Developers will find that it makes it easy to add OSLC capabilities to any Node or Express Web application, including client and server components of that application.</description>
