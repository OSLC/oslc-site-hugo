      <title>What is the difference between RDF and JSON?</title>

      <description>RDF is a family of W3C standards and a general, standard method for describing information implemented as web resources. Some of W3C standards describe specific serialization formats of RDF resources including RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples, N-Quads, and Notation3. JSON is the standard, human readable, text representation of JavaScript objects. So RDF and JSON are similar in that both can be human readable text representations of information. However RDF is based on mathematical relations in the form of (subject, predicate, object) triples.</description>

      <title>What is the difference between OSLC and a SPARQL endpoint?</title>

      <description>A SPARQL endpoint is provided by a REST server that supports the execution of SQPARL queries and returns the query results either constructed RDF graphs or result sets in a standard format. OSLC also supports a query capability, but is not coupled directly to SPARQL. OSLC query was intended to specify a simple, easy to implement, reasonably efficient to execute query language that could be adapted to many different data sources including SQL, and RDF data sources supporting SPARQL.</description>

      <title>What is the difference between OSLC and microservices?</title>

      <description>OSLC defines a set of application integration capabilities based on HTTP, RDF and LDP. Microservices represent an architectural style that factors applications into loosely coupled services that implement business capabilities. This is not a new concept. The ideas of maximizing functional cohesion and minimizing coupling in order to support efficient and effective development, maintenance and reuse of application components is the foundation of modern software engineering disciplines. Microservices are often build on the WWW REST architecture, and have become a popular way of developing RESTful applications.</description>

      <title>What is the difference between OSLC and openAPI/Swagger?</title>

      <description>Swagger.io is a popular framework of API developer tools for describing and managing REST APIs. SmartBear Software donated the Swagger Specification directly to the Open API Initiative (OAI) as the basis of the Open Specification managed by openapis.org. The OAI was created to support an industry standard for describing REST APIs in order to promote application integration. OSLC is one such REST API, that can be described using Swagger.io, that defines a standard set of application integration capabilities that have been found useful in creating development and lifecycle management toolchains.</description>

      <title>What is the relationship between OSLC specifications and W3C standards?</title>

      <description>OSLC builds on the web architecture. HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State) represents the WWW architecture in which RESTful HTTP resources represent the state of some entity and the link elements in the representation represent possible future states and related resources. HTTP addresses complexity through HTTP and REST as the standard mechanism for distributed, loosely coupled APIs. LDP builds on HTTP by reducing variability through self-describing, semantically rich, linked data resources that facilitate HATEOAS.</description>

      <title>Why aren&#39;t OSLC specifications W3C standards?</title>

      <description>W3C is focused on shaping the future of the Internet Architecture. OASIS on the other hand focuses on the development, convergence and adoption of open standards for the global information society. OSLC uses and builds on the W3C REST Internet Architecture including HTTP and LDP. However, OSLC is a use of the REST architecture in support of lifecycle management tool integration, it does not contribute to that architecture.</description>

      <title>Is OSLC only for software/systems engineering?</title>

      <description>No - the Web is neutral and can be used to share any information. OSLC data on the Web can describe any information in the same way as HTML documents can describe any information.</description>
