      <description>We finally have some great news to share! After starting the OSLC Open Project in May 2019 and having a long summer with various people being off for vacations, we have prepared the first specification for publication, updated the templates and fixed major outstanding issues. The OSLC OP Project Governing Board has approved the publication of the Change Management 2.1 PSD (Project Specification Draft) 03.
This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to announce a big step forward for OSLC!
The most exciting thing that we heard throughout the OSLCfest 2018 conference was that people were eager to contribute and were asking for a simpler, more streamlined way to provide contributions and make their voices heard. After exploring several alternatives, the OSLC Steering Committee decided to shift ongoing work from the OASIS Technical Committees to a new OSLC Open Project under the recently-announced OASIS Open Project program.</description>
