      <description>We finally have some great news to share! After starting the OSLC Open Project in May 2019 and having a long summer with various people being off for vacations, we have prepared the first specification for publication, updated the templates and fixed major outstanding issues. The OSLC OP Project Governing Board has approved the publication of the Change Management 2.1 PSD (Project Specification Draft) 03.
This specification defines the OSLC Change Management domain, a RESTful web services interface for the management of product change requests, activities, tasks and relationships between those and related resources such as requirements, test cases, or architectural resources.</description>

      <description>We are pleased to announce a big step forward for OSLC!
The most exciting thing that we heard throughout the OSLCfest 2018 conference was that people were eager to contribute and were asking for a simpler, more streamlined way to provide contributions and make their voices heard. After exploring several alternatives, the OSLC Steering Committee decided to shift ongoing work from the OASIS Technical Committees to a new OSLC Open Project under the recently-announced OASIS Open Project program.</description>

      <description>The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) steering committee is gathering feedback from the community to help shape the future vision and mission for OSLC. As part of that effort a survey of the community members was conducted and it highlights some interesting results about the needs of this group. You can find the full results of the survey at https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-2XVJT6CR/.
OSLC is an open community that builds standards to solve a vexing problem: How to integrate the specialized software used by different types of software and systems development practitioners so teams and their tools can work together.</description>

      <description>Open Services for Life-cycle Collaboration or OSLC defines a set of standard capabilities enabling loosely coupled, open and scalable point-to-point integration between heterogeneous software development tools. OSLC allows users to work seamlessly across their preferred tools and does not require complex interchange of data between tools that may result in information redundancy and maintenance issues.
The OASIS OSLC Core 3.0 Specifications represent the continued evolution of OSLC through collaborating organizations to provide the standards, APIs and tools that support integrated product, system and application lifecycle management.</description>

      <description>Whether you live in the I/T or Systems world, software integration in heterogeneous environments can represent both a challenge (where do I even start?) and opportunity (how can I advance my environment to provide more value, deliver faster and with reduced risk?).
Communities like openservices and OASIS OSLC collaboratively discuss lifecycle integration challenges and solutions that leverage open standards. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re here to contribute your knowledge and experience or to learn from others, we&amp;rsquo;re all in it together.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned almost a year ago, Iâ€™ve been plugging away at a new look and feel for this site. I have a project on GitHub; you can open issues or discuss the direction in general; you can look at proposed sample pages.
And as of today, youâ€™ll be able to see how it looks live. Iâ€™ll be rolling out elements of it gradually. There are a number of moving parts and I want to test thoroughly.</description>
